<h2 class="eee">PREFACE</h2>
<p>No part of the United States is so foreign
of aspect as our great Southwest. The
broad, lonely plains, the deserts with their
mystery and color, the dry water courses,
the long, low mountain chains seemingly
bare of vegetation, the oases of cultivation
where the fruits of the Orient flourish, the
brilliant sunshine, the deliciousness of the
pure, dry air&mdash;all this suggests Syria or
northern Africa or Spain. Added to this
are the remains everywhere of an old, old
civilization that once lived out its life here&mdash;it
may have been when Nineveh was building
or when Thebes was young. Moreover,
there is the contemporary interest of Indian
and Mexican life such as no other part of
the country affords.</p>
<p>In this little volume the author has attempted,
in addition to outlining practical
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
information for the traveler, to hint at this
wealth of human association that gives the
crowning touch to the Southwest&rsquo;s charm
of scenery. The records of Spanish explorers
and missionaries, the legends of the
aborigines (whose myths and folklore have
been studied and recorded by scholars like
Bandelier, Matthews, Hough, Cushing,
Stevenson, Hodge, Lummis, and others)
furnish the raw material of a great native
literature. Painters long since discovered
the fascination of our Southwest; writers,
as yet, have scarcely awakened to it.</p>

<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">SANTA FE&mdash;THE ROYAL CITY OF SAINT FRANCIS&rsquo;S HOLY FAITH</span></h2>
<p>Someone&mdash;I think it was that picturesque
historian of our Southwest, Mr. Charles F.
Lummis&mdash;has summed up New Mexico as
&ldquo;sun, silence and adobe;&rdquo; and of these three
components the one that is apt to strike the
Eastern newcomer most forcibly is adobe.
This homely gift of nature&mdash;hard as brick
in dry weather, plastic as putty and sticky
as glue in wet&mdash;is the bulwark of the New
Mexican&rsquo;s well-being. His crops are raised
in it; he fences in his cattle with it; he himself
lives in it; for of it are built those colorless,
square, box-like houses, flat-roofed and
eaveless which, on our first arrival in New
Mexico, we declared an architectural abomination,
and within a week fell eternally in
love with. An adobe house wall is anywhere
from two to five feet thick, a fact that conduces
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
to coolness in summer, warmth in
winter, and economy at all seasons. Given
possession of a bit of ground, you grub up
a few square yards of the earth, mix it with
water and wheat chaff, and shovel the mixture
into a wooden mold. You then lift the
mold and lo! certain big, brown bricks upon
the ground. These the fiery New Mexican
sun bakes hard for you in a couple of days&mdash;bricks
that are essentially the same as
those of ancient Babylon and Egypt, and
the recipe for which (received by the Spanish
probably from their Moorish conquerors)
is one of Spain&rsquo;s most valued contributions
to America. Old Santa Fe was
built entirely of this material, and most of
latter day Santa Fe still is, though there is
a growing disposition on the part of the
well-to-do to substitute burned brick and
concrete.</p>
<p>As a rule these adobe dwellings are of
one story, and the more pretentious are constructed
partly or entirely about an inner
court, such as in Spain is called a <i>patio</i>, but
in New Mexico a <i>plazita</i>, that is, a little
plaza. A cheerful sanctuary is this <i>plazita</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
where trees cast dappled shadows and hollyhocks
and marigolds bloom along the sunny
walls. Upon it the doors and windows of
the various rooms open, and here the family
life centers. By the kitchen door Trinidad
prepares her <i>frijoles</i> and chili, while the
children tease her for tidbits; upon the grass
the house rugs and <i>serapes</i> are spread on
cleaning days, in kaleidoscopic array, and
beaten within an inch of their lives; here,
of summer evenings Juan lounges and
smokes and Juanita swings in the hammock
strumming a guitar, or the family gramophone
plays &ldquo;La Golondrina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Comparisons are always invidious, but if
there be among the cities of the United
States, one that is richer in picturesqueness,
in genuine romance, in varied historic,
archaeologic and ethnologic interest, than
Santa Fe, it has still I think to make good
its claims. The distinction of being the
oldest town in our country, as has sometimes
been claimed, is, however, not Santa
Fe&rsquo;s.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> Indeed, the exact date of its founding
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
is still subject to some doubt, though
the weight of evidence points to 1605. Nor
was it even the original white settlement in
New Mexico. That honor belongs to the
long since obliterated San Gabriel, the site
of which was on or near the present-day
hamlet of Chamita, overlooking the Rio
Grande about 35 miles north of Santa Fe.
There in 1598 the conqueror of New Mexico,
Don Juan de O&ntilde;ate (a rich citizen of
Zacatecas, and the Spanish husband, by the
way, of a granddaughter of Montezuma)
established his little capital, maintaining it
there until the second town was founded.
To this latter place was given the name <i>La
Villa Real de Santa F&eacute; de San Francisco de
As&iacute;s</i>&mdash;the Royal City of Saint Francis of
Assisi&rsquo;s Holy Faith. Naturally that was
too large a mouthful for daily use, and it
was long ago pared down to just Santa Fe,
though Saint Francis never lost his status
as the city&rsquo;s patron. In point of antiquity,
the most that can justly be claimed for it
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
is that it is the first permanent white settlement
in the West.</p>
<p>The situation of Santa Fe is captivating,
in the midst of a sunny, breeze-swept plain
in the lap of the Southern Rockies, at an
elevation of 7000 feet above the sea.
Through the middle of the city flows the
little, tree-bordered Rio de Santa F&eacute;, which
issues a couple of miles away from a gorge
in the imposing Sierra Sangre de Cristo
(the Mountains of the Blood of Christ),
whose peaks, often snow-clad, look majestically
down in the north from a height of
10,000 to 13,000 feet. The town is reached
from Lamy<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> by a branch of the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, which climbs
due north for 18 miles through an uninhabitated
waste dotted with low-growing
pi&ntilde;on, juniper and scrub. At the station
a small army of bus, hack and automobile
men greet you with enthusiasm, and to reach
your hotel you have only the choice of them
or your own trotters, for street cars there
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
are none. In Santa Fe, however, no place
is far from any other place&mdash;the population
is but a scant 8500. Of these a large percentage
is of Spanish blood, and Spanish
speech and Spanish signs engage your attention
on every hand.</p>
<p>The hub of the city is the Plaza&mdash;warm
and sunny in winter, shady and cool in
summer. Seated here on a bench you soon
arrive at a lazy man&rsquo;s notion of the sort of
place you are in. Here the donkeys patter
by laden with firewood&mdash;dearest of Santa
Fe&rsquo;s street pictures; here Mexican peddlers
of apples and <i>dulces</i>, <i>pi&ntilde;ones</i> and shoe-strings
ply their mild trade, and Tesuque
Indians, with black hair bound about with
scarlet <i>bandas</i>, pass by to the trader&rsquo;s, their
blankets bulging with native pottery, or, in
season, their wagons loaded with melons,
grapes, apples, and peaches. Of afternoons
the newsboys loiter about crying the papers,
and you have a choice of your news in
English or Spanish; and on Sundays and
holidays the band plays athletically in its
little kiosk, the crowd promenading around
and around the while very much as in Old
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Mexico, and strewing the ground behind it
with pi&ntilde;on and peanut shells.</p>
<p>Close to the Plaza, too, cluster many of
the historied spots of Santa Fe; indeed, the
Plaza itself is a chief one. On this bit of
ground it is confidently believed that O&ntilde;ate
must have camped in 1605&mdash;if it was 1605&mdash;when
the capital was transferred from San
Gabriel; and there is no doubt whatever
that here was the seething center of the
famous Pueblo revolt of 1680, when 3000
infuriated Indians cooped the entire Spanish
population of Santa Fe within the Governor&rsquo;s
Palace opposite, and kept them
there for a week. Then the whites made a
brave sortie, caught and hanged 50 Indians
in the Plaza and escaped to Old Mexico&mdash;their
exit being celebrated shortly afterwards
in this same Plaza by the Indians&rsquo;
making a bonfire of all Spanish archives
and church belongings they could lay hands
on. Here 13 years later came De Vargas,
the re-conqueror of New Mexico (bearing
it is said the very standard under which
O&ntilde;ate had marched in the original conquest),
and with his soldiers knelt before
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
the reinstated cross. And it was in this
Plaza in 1846, during our Mexican War,
that General Stephen Kearny ran up the
Stars and Stripes and took possession of
the territory in the name of the United
States. It was the Plaza, too, that formed
the western terminus of the Old Santa Fe
Trail&mdash;that famous highway of trade that
bound New Mexico with Anglo-Saxondom
throughout the Mexican regime in the
Southwest and until the iron horse and
Pullman cars superseded mules and Conestoga
wagons. At the old adobe hotel known
as La Fonda, a remnant of which still stands
at this writing just across from the southeast
corner of the Plaza, travelers and teamsters,
plainsmen and trappers found during
half a century that boisterous brand of
cheer dear to the pioneer soul&mdash;cheer made
up quite largely of cards, <i>aguardiente</i> and
the freedom of firearms, but gone now, let
us trust, out of the world forever since the
world has lost its frontiers.</p>
<p>Facing the Plaza on the north is the
ancient <i>Palacio Real</i> or Governor&rsquo;s Palace&mdash;a
long, one-storied adobe building occupying
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
the length of the block, and faced with
the covered walk or portico (they call such
a <i>portal</i> in New Mexico) which in former
years was a feature of every building of
importance in Santa Fe. Within its thick
walls for nearly three centuries the governors
of New Mexico resided&mdash;Spaniards,
Pueblo Indians, Spaniards again, Mexicans
and finally Americans.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> In 1909 the building
was set aside as the home of the Museum
of New Mexico (since removed to a handsome
edifice of its own in the New Mexico
style of architecture across the street), and
of the School of American Research.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
Some careful restoration work was then
done, necessary to remove modern accretions
and lay bare certain interesting architectural
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
features incorporated by the original
builders, such as the handwrought woodwork,
the fireplaces, doorways, etc., so that
the edifice as it appears today is outwardly
very much as it must have looked a century
or two ago. The festoons of dried Indian
ears, however, which are said to have been
a rather constant adornment of the <i>portal</i>
in old times, are now, to the relief of sensitive
souls, humanely absent. Within, the
Palace is a mine of information for the
curious in the history, archaeology and ethnology
of our Southwest, and a leisurely
visit to it makes a useful preliminary to
one&rsquo;s travels about the State. The building
is open to all without charge.</p>
<p>A short block from the Plaza is the
Cathedral of San Francisco, whose unfinished
trunks of towers are a prominent
feature in Santa Fe&rsquo;s low sky-line. You
may or may not get something from a visit
to it. It is a modern structure, still incomplete,
built upon and about an older church
believed to date from 1622. Beneath the
altar reposes all that is mortal of two
seventeenth century Franciscan missionaries
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
to the New Mexico aborigines. Of one
of these, Padre Ger&oacute;nimo de la Llana, I
cannot forbear a word of mention. He
was a true brother of Saint Francis, and
for many years ministered lovingly to the
Indians of the long since ruined pueblo of
Quara&iacute;, a place of which more later. At
Quara&iacute; he died in 1659, and his body was
interred in the old church there whose walls
still stand, one of the most striking ruins
in New Mexico. To his Indians he was
no less than a saint, and when (under attacks
from Apaches, doubtless) they abandoned
their pueblos about 1670, they bore
with them what remained of their dear
<i>padre santo</i> to Tajique, a pueblo some 15
miles distant, and buried him there. But
in those days Apaches never ceased from
raiding, and from Tajique, too, some years
later, those Pueblo folk were forced to flee&mdash;this
time across the rugged Sierra Manzano
to Isleta on the Rio Grande. That
was a journey of too great hardship, I suppose,
to admit of carrying the now crumbled
padre with them; so he was left in his unmarked
tomb in a savage-harried land, to
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
be quite forgotten until 85 years later (in
1759) pious old Governor F. A. Marin del
Valle heard of him. A search was speedily
set on foot and after a long quest the bones
of Padre Ger&oacute;nimo were found, brought to
Santa Fe, and becomingly once more interred.
Then, alas! the poor brother
dropped out of mind again until in 1880,
when during some work upon the new
Cathedral, the discovery of an inscription
set in the wall 121 years before by Governor
del Valle led to the finding of the grave. I
think you will be interested to read the
quaint Spanish epitaphs of this fine old
friar, and of his companion, too, Padre
Asencio de Z&aacute;rate, sometime of Picur&iacute;s
pueblo. They may be found behind the high
altar, which hides them.</p>
<p>Also in the Cathedral, it is believed, rests
the mortality of Don Diego de Vargas, <i>el
Reconquistador</i>, but unmarked. You will
find many an echo of him in Santa Fe, for
he it was who in 1692 re-conquered New
Mexico for Spain after the Pueblo uprising
of 1680 had swept the Spaniards out of
the province and for twelve years kept them
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
out. Every year in June Santa Fe celebrates
its De Vargas Day, when a procession,
bearing at its head an image of the
Virgin, marches from the Cathedral to the
little Rosario Chapel that is dedicated to
Our Lady of the Rosary (or as Santa
F&eacute;ans sometimes call her, <i>La Conquistadora</i>,
the Lady Conqueror). It occupies the spot,
on the city outskirts, where according to
tradition De Vargas knelt on the eve of his
second entry into the capital (December 16,
1693), and invoking the blessing of the
Virgin upon his arms, promised her a
chapel if she vouchsafed him victory on the
morrow. It is a scant half-hour&rsquo;s stroll
thither from the Plaza, and you will enjoy
the walk through the city&rsquo;s half foreign
scenes, though the building itself is disappointing
because of its handling by tasteless
renovators. Much more picturesque, though
modernized with an astonishing steeple, is
the little church of Guadalupe, standing
amid Lombardy poplars on the south bank
of the river. A quiet, reposeful, little
temple, this, with beautifully carved ceiling
beams and a curious, if crude, altar-piece
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
representing the appearances of Mexico&rsquo;s
Heavenly Patroness to Juan Diego.</p>
<p>Of the churches in Santa Fe, however,
the one that is made most of by visitors, is
the square-towered adobe of San Miguel.
It is a pleasant twenty-minute walk from
the Plaza (and, by all means, do walk when
you go, for the way thither is too picturesque
to be whisked over in an automobile)&mdash;through
quiet, unpaved streets lined with
one-storied adobe houses and often too
narrow to accommodate any but a mere
thread of sidewalk, where you bump into
burros and, like as not, have utter strangers
tip their hats to you with a <i>buenos dias,
se&ntilde;or</i>. You pass the Bishop&rsquo;s sequestered
gardens and the high-walled grounds of the
Convent and Academy of the Sisters of
Loretto, with glimpses through a postern
gate of old-fashioned flower beds; and
further on, the touching little cemetery of
the Sisters, each simple grave marked by
a cross whereon vines and fragrant flowers
lean lovingly; and so, on stepping stones, to
the south side of the little Rio de Santa Fe.
Then mounting the hill past more gardens
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
where hollyhocks&mdash;<i>la barra de San Jos&eacute;</i>
(St. Joseph&rsquo;s rod) the New Mexicans call
them&mdash;nod at you over the walls, and children
prattle in Spanish and women sing at
their work, there you are before old San
Miguel.</p>
<p>Your first feeling is a bit of a shock, for
the renovator&rsquo;s hand has fallen heavily upon
San Miguel and, frankly speaking, it is a
rather hideous old church as viewed from
the street. When, however, you have rung
the sacristan&rsquo;s bell and a Christian Brother
from the adjoining Catholic college has
come with the keys to usher you within, you
pass in a twinkling into the twilight heart
of the Seventeenth Century. Here are
blackened, old religious paintings said to
have been carried by the Conquistadores as
standards of defense in battle; a wonderful
old bell inscribed with a prayer to St. Joseph
and bearing an all but illegible date that
looks surprisingly like 1356, and maybe it
is; a charming old wooden cross-beam supporting
the <i>coro</i>, or choir gallery, its color
mellowed by time and its surface carved
with rude but beautiful flutings and flourishes
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
by some long-vanished hand of the
wilderness; and so on&mdash;all delightfully embellished
by the na&iuml;ve expositions of the
kindly Brother who acts as cicerone. And
do not leave without a glimpse through the
side door of the sunny quiet garden close,
that lies between the church and the college
building. As to the age of San Miguel,
there has been much misinformation given&mdash;claims
of its dating from 1543 being quite
groundless. The known fact is that it was
established as a chapel for the Mexican
(Tlascalan) Indians who were part of the
original Santa Fe colony. It therefore dates
from some time on the hither side of 1605.
In 1680 it suffered partial destruction in
the Pueblo uprising, though its walls survived;
and, after some repairs by order of
De Vargas, it was finally restored completely
in 1710, by the Spanish governor of
that time, the Marquis de la Pe&ntilde;uela. The
record of this fact inscribed in Spanish
upon the main beam of the gallery is still
one of the interesting &ldquo;bits&rdquo; in the church.
Probably it is safe to call San Miguel the
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
oldest existing building for Christian worship
in the United States.</p>
<p>If you are in a hurry you may &ldquo;do&rdquo;
Santa Fe and its immediate environs in a
carriage or an automobile in a couple of
days, and departing secretly think it a rather
overrated little old place. To get into the
atmosphere of it, however, you should drop
hurry at its gates and make up your mind
to spend at least a week there, and longer
if you can. Lounge in the Plaza and watch
the ebb and flow of the city life that
gathers here; drop into the Indian trading
stores and get a taste for aboriginal
art. White man&rsquo;s schooling has brought
about of late years a decline in the quality
of Indian handicraft, but there is still a lot
of interest in these Santa Fe curio shops&mdash;Navajo
and Ch&iacute;mayo blankets, Pueblo pottery,
Navajo silver jewelry, Apache baskets,
moccasins, bead-work, quaint tobacco pouches,
Spanish and Mexican things&mdash;<i>serapes</i>,
<i>mantillas</i>, rusty daggers, old silver snuff
boxes&mdash;and what not. Mount the hill at
the city&rsquo;s northern edge, and sit on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
ruined walls of the old <i>garita</i> (where the
Mexican customs used to be levied upon
imports by the Santa Fe Trail). There you
get a magnificent bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the
city in its mountain fastness, and if the day
be waning you will have a sunset for your
benediction, long to remember. Extend
your rambles sometimes to the outskirts for
unadvertised sights&mdash;the little ranches with
their outdoor threshing floors of beaten
earth where in August you may see the
wheat tramped out by horses, sheep or goats,
and winnowed by tossing in the breeze;
<i>paisanas</i> washing their linen on stones by
the brookside as in Italy or Spain; and the
gaunt <i>descansos</i> or crosses of rest, marking
stopping places of funerals, and carving in
illiterate Spanish scrawled upon the wood,
prayers for the repose of departed souls. If
you are fortunate enough to have a little
Spanish, your enjoyment will be enhanced
by stopping at humble doorways for a bit
of chat with Juan Bautista the woodchopper,
or Maria Rosal&iacute;a the laundress. You will
be civilly welcome, if you yourself are civil,
and be handed a chair, if there be one, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
will be refreshed to learn something of the
essential oneness and kindliness of the
human family whether clothed in white skin
or brown. It is this pervading air of Old
Worldliness that makes the peculiar charm
of Santa Fe for the leisurely traveler&mdash;its
romance and its history are not altogether
hidden away in books, but are an obvious
part of its living present.</p>
<p>Moreover, Santa Fe is the starting point
for numerous interesting out-of-town trips.
These are story for another chapter.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">THE UPPER RIO GRANDE, ITS PUEBLOS AND ITS CLIFF DWELLINGS</span></h2>
<p>Of course you must make the trip&mdash;a half
day will suffice for it&mdash;from Santa Fe to
Tesuque, a village of the Pueblo Indians 9
miles to the north, and you should pronounce
it <i>Te-soo&acute;kay</i>. If your knowledge of Indians
has been limited to the variety seen in Wild
West Shows and historical pictures, you will
be surprised at those you find at Tesuque.
This is a quaint adobe village around a
spacious plaza upon which an ancient, whitewashed
Catholic church faces. The houses
when of more than one story are built terrace-like,
so that the roof of the first story
forms a front yard to the second. Ladders
lean against the outer walls, by which access
is gained to the upper rooms. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
population of about 150 live very much like
their Mexican neighbors, raising by irrigation
crops of corn, beans, peaches, melons,
and alfalfa, accepting meanwhile from the
liberal hand of Nature rabbits, <i>pi&ntilde;ones</i> and
wild plums, and pasturing sheep and cattle
on the communal pueblo lands which Spain
granted them centuries ago and which our
Government confirmed to them upon the
acquisition of New Mexico. Their method
of town building is not borrowed from the
whites, but is their own; and because the
Spanish Conquistadores of the sixteenth century
found the region sprinkled with such
permanent villages, called <i>pueblos</i> in Spanish,
they named the people Pueblo Indians&mdash;a
term which well characterizes them in contra-distinction
to the nomadic tribes, whose
villages moved as the tribe moved.</p>
<p>Tesuque is a type of a score or so of
pueblos scattered along a line of some 300
miles in northern New Mexico and Arizona.
Formerly the dress of these Indians was
quite distinctive, but association with the
whites has modified its quality of late years,
though it still retains some of the old features&mdash;particularly
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
in the case of the women,
who are more disposed than the men to
conservatism. Their native costume is a
dark woolen gown belted at the waist and
falling a little below the knees, and a sort
of cape of colored muslin fastened about
the neck and hanging down the back. The
lower part of the legs is often swathed in a
buckskin extension of the moccasins in
which the feet are encased. The hair is
banged low upon the forehead and both
women&rsquo;s and men&rsquo;s are clubbed at the back
and bound with red yarn. The native attire
of the men is a loose cotton shirt worn outside
short, wide trousers. Instead of a hat
a narrow <i>banda</i> of colored cotton or silk
is bound about the hair.</p>
<p>Each village has its local government&mdash;and
a very competent sort it is&mdash;of a democratic
nature, a governor, as well as a few
other officials, being elected annually by
popular vote. Besides these, there is a permanent
council of old men who assist in the
direction of affairs. Most of the Pueblo
Indians are nominal adherents to Roman
Catholicism, but have by no means lost hold
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
of their pagan faith. On the patron saint&rsquo;s
day a public fiesta is always held. After
mass in the church, there are native dances
and ceremonies, accompanied by feasting
continuing well into the night. November
12, St. James&rsquo;s Day, is the day celebrated
by Tesuque, and visitors are many.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The Pueblos are as a class industrious,
fun-loving, and friendly to white visitors.
They are naturally hospitable and quickly
responsive to any who treat them sympathetically
and as fellow human beings. The
lamentable fact that white Americans have
too often failed in this respect, acting towards
them as though they were animals in
a zoo, is largely responsible for tales we
hear of Indian surliness and ill-will. Pueblo
women are skillful potters, and while Tesuque
does not now excel in this art, one may
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
pick up some interesting souvenirs both in
clay and beadwork. At any rate, you will
enjoy seeing these things being made in the
common living-room of the house, while
the corn is being ground on the <i>metates</i> or
mealing stones, and the mutton stew simmers
on the open hearth. A knowledge of
values first obtained at reputable traders&rsquo;
shops in Santa Fe, is advisable, however,
before negotiating directly with the Indians,
as they are becoming pretty well schooled
in the art of charging &ldquo;all the traffic will
bear.&rdquo; Tesuque produces a specialty in the
shape of certain dreadful little pottery images
called &ldquo;rain gods,&rdquo; which must not be
taken seriously as examples of sound Pueblo
art.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Thirty-three miles north of Santa Fe on
the Denver and Rio Grande Railway is the
village of Espa&ntilde;ola, where a plain but comfortable
hotel makes a convenient base for
visiting several points of interest in the upper
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
Rio Grande Valley. A mile to the south
is Santa Clara pueblo,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> long famous for its
beautiful shining black pottery almost Etruscan
in shape. The clay naturally burns red,
but a second baking with the fuel (dried
chips of cattle manure), pulverized finely
and producing a dense black smoke, gives
the ware its characteristic lustrous black.
Seven miles further down the river but on
the other side, is another pueblo, San Ildefonso,
a picturesque village of 125 Indians,
near the base of La Mesa Hu&eacute;rfana. This
is a flat-topped mountain of black lava,
on whose summit in 1693, several hundred
Pueblos entrenched themselves and for eight
months stubbornly resisted the attempts of
the Spanish under De Vargas to bring them
to terms. That was practically the last stand
of Pueblo rebeldom, which thirteen years
before had driven every Spaniard from the
land. San Ildefonso has public fiestas on
January 23 and September 6.</p>
<p>Six miles north of Espa&ntilde;ola and close to
the Rio Grande is San Juan pueblo, with a
population of about 400 Indians. Here one
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
is in the very cradle of the white civilization
of the Southwest. At this spot in the
summer of 1598, Don Juan de O&ntilde;ate&mdash;he
of the Conquest&mdash;arrived with his little
army of Spaniards, his Franciscan missionaries,
his colonist families, a retinue of
servants and Mexican Indians, his wagons
and cattle, to found the capital of the newly
won &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo; later to be called New
Mexico. The courtesy of the Indians there,
who temporarily gave up their own houses
to the Spaniards, was so marked that their
pueblo became known as <i>San Juan de los
Caballeros</i> (Saint John of the Gentlemen).
O&ntilde;ate&rsquo;s settlement&mdash;of which no vestige
now remains&mdash;is believed to have been situated
just across the Rio Grande from San
Juan, about where the hamlet and railway
station of Chamita now stands. San Juan
pueblo is further distinguished as the birthplace
of Pop&eacute;, the Indian to whose executive
genius is due the success of the Pueblo Rebellion
of 1680. A picturesque figure, that
same Pop&eacute;, of the timber dramatic heroes
are made of. It is said that, while meditating
the rebellion, he journeyed to the enchanted
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
lagoon of Sh&iacute;papu, the place where
in the dim past the Pueblos had emerged
from the underworld and whither they return
at death. There he conferred with the
spirits of his ancestors, who endued him
with power to lead his people to victory.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>
The San Juan women make a good black
pottery similar to that of Santa Clara. On
Saint John&rsquo;s Day, June 24, occurs a public
fiesta, with procession and dances, attracting
visitors, white and red, from far and near.</p>
<p>Having got thus far up the Rio Grande,
let nothing deter you from visiting Taos
(they pronounce it <i>Towss</i>). By automobile
it is about 50 miles northeast of Espa&ntilde;ola
or you can reach it quite expeditiously by
Denver &amp; Rio Grande train to Taos Junction
and auto-connection thence about 30
miles to Taos.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> Situated in a fertile plain,
7000 feet above the sea, in the heart of
the Southern Rockies, Taos is one of the
most charming places in America. It is in
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
three parts. There is the outlying hamlet
Ranchos de Taos; then the picturesque Mexican
town Fernandez de Taos, famous in
recent years for a resident artist colony
whose pictures have put Taos in the world
of art; and lastly, there is the pueblo of
Taos. From very early times the pueblo
has played an important role in New Mexican
history. It was here the San Juane&ntilde;o
Pop&eacute; found the readiest response to his
plans of rebellion. Later the location on
the confines of the Great Plains made it an
important trading center with the more
northern Indians. The annual summer fair
for <i>cambalache</i>, or traffic by barter, held at
Taos in the latter part of the eighteenth century,
was a famous event, the Plains tribes
bringing skins and furs and Indian captives
to trade for horses, beads and metal implements.
The commercial opportunities combined
with the fertility of the soil and an
unfailing water supply led to the founding
of Fernandez de Taos by whites. In the
days of Mexican supremacy part of the
traffic over the Santa Fe Trail passed this
way and a custom house was here. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
ruins of a large adobe church in the pueblo
form a memento of the troublous days of
1847, when a small rebellion participated in
by Mexicans and a few Taos Indians took
place here and the American governor, Bent,
was murdered. At Fernandez de Taos,
the famous frontiersman Kit Carson lived
for many years, and here his grave may
still be seen.</p>
<p>Taos pueblo, housing an Indian population
of about 500, is the most northern in
New Mexico, and perhaps the most perfect
specimen existing of Pueblo architecture.
It consists of two imposing pyramidal house
clusters of 5 to 7 stories&mdash;aboriginal apartment
houses&mdash;and between them happily
flows the little Rio de Taos sparkling out of
the Glorieta Ca&ntilde;on near whose mouth the
pueblo stands. The three-mile drive or
walk from Fernandez de Taos is very lovely,
with the pueblo&rsquo;s noble background of
mountains before you, their purple and
green flanks wonderfully mottled and dashed
in autumn with the gold of the aspen
forests. The men of Taos are a tall, athletic
sort, quite different in appearance
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
from the more southern Pueblos. They wear
the hair parted in the middle and done at
the side in two braids which hang in front
of the shoulders. They are much addicted
to their blankets; and one often sees them
at work with the blankets fastened about
the waist and falling to the knees like a
skirt. In warm weather they sometimes
substitute a muslin sheet for the woolen
blanket, and few sights are more striking
than a Taos man thus muffled to his eyebrows
in pure white.</p>
<p>Annually on September 30th occurs the
<i>Fiesta de San Ger&oacute;nimo de Taos</i>, which is
one of the most largely attended of all
Pueblo functions. Crowds of Americans,
Mexicans and Indians (a sprinkling of
Apaches among Pueblos of several sorts)
line the terraced pyramids and make a scene
so brilliant and strange that one wonders
that it can be in America. The evening before,
near sundown, there is a beautiful
Indian dance in the plaza of the pueblo, the
participants bearing branches of quivering
aspens. With the sunset light upon the
orange and yellow of the foliage as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
evening shadows gather, it is an unforgettable
sight. Yes, you must by all means
see Taos. There are hotel accommodations
at Fernandez de Taos.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>But Espa&ntilde;ola serves, too, as a base for
outings of quite another sort. One of these
is to the remarkable prehistoric cliff village
known as the Puy&eacute; in the Santa Clara
Ca&ntilde;on, about 10 miles west of Espa&ntilde;ola.
Here at the edge of a pine forest a vast
tufa cliff rises, its face marked with pictographs
of unknown antiquity and honeycombed
with dwellings of a vanished people,
probably ancestors, of some of the present-day
Pueblos.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> These cliff chambers are
quite small, and their walls bear still the
soot from prehistoric fires. Climbing by
an ancient trail to the summit of the mesa
of which the cliff is a side, you come upon
the leveled ruins of what was once a magnificent,
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
terraced community house, built
of tufa blocks and containing hundreds of
rooms. Rambling from room to room,
picking up now a bit of broken pottery, now
a charred corn-cob, poking into the ashes
of fireplaces where the last embers were
quenched before history in America began,
you experience, I hope, a becoming sense of
your youth as a white American. And the
view from this noble tableland&mdash;a view
those ancient people had every day of their
lives! One wonders had they eyes to see
it&mdash;the lovely valley of the Rio Grande,
purple chain after chain of mountains on
every side, the jagged peaks of the Sangre
de Cristo, the Glorietas, the Jemes, and dim
on the far horizon, the Sierra Blanca in
Colorado.</p>
<p>Also dotting the same plateau (this region
by the way, is now called Pajarito<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a>
Park) are numerous other prehistoric community
houses&mdash;the Otowi (with its curious
tent-like rock formations), the Ts&aacute;nkawi,
the Tchrega&mdash;all of absorbing interest to
the archaeologic mind, but offering not much
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
that seems new to the average tourist who
has seen the Puy&eacute;. One, however, known
as the Tyuonyi in the ca&ntilde;on of the Rito
de los Frijoles<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> should not be missed. It
may be reached via Buckman, a station on
the D. &amp; R. G. 12 miles south of Espa&ntilde;ola.
Thence it is about 15 miles over all sorts of
a road to the brink of Frijoles Ca&ntilde;on. A
steep foot-trail there leads you down, a thousand
feet or more, into the gorge and after
a short walk you are at the comfortable
ranch house of Judge A. G. Abbott, custodian
of the Bandelier National Monument,
under which name the neighboring ruins
are officially designated by the United States
Government, which owns them.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> Considered
merely as scenery, the little, secluded
ca&ntilde;on is one of the loveliest spots in New
Mexico, with its stretches of emerald meadows,
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
its perennial stream and its peaceful
forest of stately pines. But it is the human
interest given by the vacant houses of a
forgotten race&mdash;the cavate dwellings of the
pink and white tufa cliffs and the ruined
communal dwellings on the ca&ntilde;on floor and
on the mesa top near by&mdash;that brings most
visitors. That noted ethnologist, the late
Adolf F. Bandelier, wrote a romance with
the scene laid here and at the Puy&eacute;. It is
entitled &ldquo;The Delightmakers,&rdquo; and a reading
of it will not only lend a living interest
to these places, but yield a world of information
as to the mind and customs of the
Pueblo Indians. Visitors have the School
of American Archaeology at Santa Fe to
thank for the painstaking work of excavation
extending over years, that uncovered
many of these ancient dwelling places of
their centuries of accumulated debris.</p>
<p>To return to Espa&ntilde;ola. Ten miles to the
eastward in the valley of the Santa Cruz
river is the quaint little church of Santuario,
a sort of New Mexican Lourdes, famous
these many years for its miraculous cures.
A trip thither makes a noteworthy day&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
outing. It may be done by automobile over
a road of many tribulations, but a horse
and buggy are more satisfactory and far
more in keeping with the primitive country.
My own visit was achieved on foot, eased
by a lift of a couple of miles from a kindly
Mexican on horseback, who set me up behind
him, <i>en ancas</i>, as they call it. It was
mid-August&mdash;a season which in northern
New Mexico is as sunshiny and showery as
a sublimated Eastern April. The intense
blue of the sky was blotted here and there
with piled-up cloud masses, which broke at
times in streamers of rain upon the purple
ranges of the Sangre de Cristo ahead of me&mdash;and
after that, descending shafts of light.
As soon as I had crossed the Rio Grande
and Espa&ntilde;ola was behind me, I was in pure
Mexico. The Santa Cruz Valley is an agricultural
region, but it is the agriculture of
centuries ago that is in vogue there. Wheat,
for instance, is trodden out by horses, sheep
or goats, on outdoor threshing floors of
beaten earth, winnowed by tossing shovelfuls
into the air, washed of its grit and dirt
in the nearest <i>ac&eacute;quia</i>, then spread out in
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
the sun to dry, and finally ground in primitive
little log mills whose rumbling stones
are turned by tiny water wheels. Little
New Mexican Davids, bare of foot and
dreamy-eyed, loiter along behind their nibbling
flocks in the stubble of the shorn
fields or the wild herbage of the river bottom.
Peaches and melons, onions and corn,
lie drying on the roofs, and strips of meat
hang &ldquo;jerking&rdquo; from stretched lines in the
<i>plazitas</i> of the houses. The cross is still a
dominant feature in this land of yesterday.
Now it glitters on the belfry of the family
chapel among the trees of some ranch; now
it is outlined against the sky on the crest
of a hill, a <i>calvario</i> of the Penitentes;<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> now
it crowns a heap of stones by the wayside,
where a funeral has stopped to rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Of the villages strewn along this delightful
way, some are hamlets of half a dozen
straggling little adobes drowsing under their
rustling cottonwoods. Others are more important.
One particularly I remember&mdash;Santo
Ni&ntilde;o. That means &ldquo;village of the
Holy Child,&rdquo; and His peace that placid
morning seemed to rest upon it. The
streets were narrow shady lanes, where
irrigation ditches running full made a
murmuring music, flowing now by adobe
walls, now by picket fences where hollyhocks
and marigolds and morning-glories
looked pleasantly out. It was a village
not of houses merely, but of comfortable
old orchards, too, and riotous gardens
where corn and beans, chilis and melons
locked elbows in happy comradery. I think
every one I met was Mexican&mdash;the women
in sombre black rebosos, the men more or
less unkempt and bandit-appearing in ample-crowned
sombreros, yet almost without exception
offering me the courtesy of a raised
hand and a <i>buenos dias, se&ntilde;or</i>. Santa Cruz
de la Ca&ntilde;ada&mdash;another of these villages&mdash;deserves
a special word of mention, for next
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
to Santa Fe it is the oldest officially established
<i>villa</i> (a form of Spanish organized
town), in New Mexico, dating as such from
1695, though in its unincorporated state
antedating the Pueblo Rebellion. Long a
place of importance, its ancient glory paled
as Santa Fe and Albuquerque grew. Today
it numbers a scant couple of hundred inhabitants,
but it is interesting to the tourist
for its fine old church facing the grassy plaza
of the village. The church interior is enriched
with a number of ancient pictures and
carvings of an excellence beyond one&rsquo;s expectations.</p>
<p>Then there is Ch&iacute;mayo, into which you
pass just before crossing the river to Santuario.
To the general public Ch&iacute;mayo
appeals because of its blankets and its apricots,
but to me it remains a place of tender
memory because of a certain hospitable
<i>tienda de abarrotes</i> (or, as we should say,
grocery store). Entering it in the hope of
finding crackers and cheese, wherewith to
make a wayside luncheon, I was given instead
a characteristic Mexican meal as exquisitely
cooked as ever I had; yet it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
but a couple of corn tortillas, a bowl of pink
beans done to liquidity, and a cup of black
coffee. As to the blankets of Ch&iacute;mayo, they
are woven in sizes from a pillow-cover to a
bed-spread, of Germantown yarn, and you
find them on sale everywhere in the curio
shops of the Southwest, competing in a
modest way with the Navajo product. The
weaving is a fireside industry, prosecuted
in the intervals of other work both by women
and men, and the bump-bump of the
primitive looms is the characteristic melody
of the place.</p>
<p>I had to ford the little river, shoes and
stockings in hand, to reach Santuario, and
was not sure when I got there. An old
<i>paisano</i>, sitting in the shade of a wall, informed
me, however, that the little cluster
of adobes on a hillside, into which I soon
came from the river, was really the place&mdash;&ldquo;of
great fame, se&ntilde;or. Here come people
of all nations to be cured&mdash;Mexicans,
Americans, Apaches&mdash;from far, very far.&rdquo;
The adobe church, half hidden behind some
huge cottonwoods, was open&mdash;of crude construction
without and within, but very picturesque.
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Passing within the wooden doors,
which are curiously carved with a maze of
lettering that I found it impossible to decipher,
I was in a twilight faintly illumined
by the shining of many candles set upon the
floor in front of a gaudy altar. Upon the
walls hung beskirted figures of saints in
various colors and wearing tin crowns.
There were, too, crude little shrines upon
which pilgrims had scrawled their names.
A figure of San Diego on horseback with a
quirt on his wrist, cowboy style, was particularly
lively, I thought. In a room adjoining
the altar is a hole from which
pilgrims take handfuls of earth&mdash;red adobe,
apparently&mdash;the outward instrumentality
that is depended upon for the cures.</p>
<p>The history of this queer chapel is interesting.
Long before it was built the
efficacy of that hole of earth was believed
far and wide, and the place resorted to by
health seekers. Finally in 1816 a pious
<i>paisano</i> named Bernardo Abeyta, who had
prospered greatly in his affairs, was impelled
to erect this church as a testimony of gratitude
to God. Dying he bequeathed it to
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
Do&ntilde;a Carmen Chaves, his daughter, who
kept for all comers the church and its pit of
healing, and lived in a modest way upon the
fees which grateful pilgrims bestowed upon
her. After her death, the property descended
to her daughter, who maintains it in the
same way. It is said the fame of the spot
is known even in old Mexico, whence pilgrims
sometimes come.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> The earth is
utilized either internally dissolved in water,
or outwardly made into a mud wash and
rubbed on the body. The chapel is dedicated
to <i>El Se&ntilde;or de Esquipulas</i>&mdash;the Christ of
Esquipulas&mdash;Esquipulas being a little village
of Guatemala whose great church enshrines
a famous image of the Lord believed to perform
miraculous cures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>For a glimpse in small compass of the
unsuspected picturesqueness of rural New
Mexico, I know of nothing better than this
little jaunt from Espa&ntilde;ola to Santuario.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Horseback tours through the Pecos
and Santa Fe National Forests are practicabilities,
with Santa Fe, Espa&ntilde;ola or Buckman as a base.
There is a company or two at Santa Fe that
make a specialty of outfitting parties, furnishing
riding and pack animals, cooks and all needful
accessories, for a fixed sum. Trout fishing is
good in many of the mountain streams. You may
arrange your own itinerary, or if you do not
know what you want, trips will be outlined to
suit your particular interests. In the latter event,
a consultation with the Supervisor of the Santa
Fe National Forest, whose office is in Santa Fe,
would be helpful. For people of sound wind who
like to see the world from mountain tops, a trip
over the Dalton Trail to the Pecos River and
thence to the Truchas Peaks is repaying. From
that elevation of about 13,000 feet, there is a
magnificent outlook over much of New Mexico
and some of Colorado and Arizona.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">ROUNDABOUT ALBUQUERQUE</span></h2>
<p>Albuquerque is the metropolis and trade
heart of central New Mexico, and the
talk of its solid citizens runs naturally on
cattle and wool, mines and lumber, grapes
and apples and the agricultural glories of
the Rio Grande valley. The average tourist
gives it only the half-hour during which
the train stops there, and remembers it
mainly for the noteworthy Harvey Indian
collection at the station (a liberal education,
by the way, in the handicraft of the Southwestern
aborigines) and for the snap-shots
he tried to take (and was foiled in) of the
picturesque Pueblo pottery sellers on the
platform.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> In itself, indeed, the busy little
city has not a great deal that is distinctive
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
enough to interest tourists excepting the
Spanish quarter known as Old Albuquerque,
on the outskirts&mdash;a picturesque survival of
the Hispanic regime. There stands the old
church dedicated to the city&rsquo;s patron saint,
San Felipe. As a base to visit certain other
places, however, Albuquerque is very convenient.
For instance, there is the pueblo
of Isleta, 12 miles south.</p>
<p>It is from Isleta that many of the pottery
makers come whom you see offering their
wares on the railway platform at Albuquerque,
and a pleasant day may be put in
rambling about the streets of the pueblo,
chatting and trafficking with the hospitable
people, who are a very wide-awake, independent
sort of Indians. You may go
thither by train; or you may drive (a much
better way), following the west bank of
the Rio Grande, and enjoying the beauty
of a typical bit of rural New Mexico, now
austere and sun-scorched, now relenting in
vineyards, fields of corn and lush alfalfa,
and orchards of apple and peach, sandwiched
between sleepy little Mexican villages smothered
in trees and old-fashioned flowers.
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
Much of New Mexico is as foreign in aspect
as Spain, and the flat-roofed, eaveless
ranch houses, low and rambling, with enclosed
plazitas, and high-walled corrals
adjoining, into which the teams are driven
at night and the gates shut to the outer
world, bring to you the atmosphere of Don
Quixote or Lazarillo de Tormes. Architecturally,
Isleta differs widely from the
orthodox pueblo type, its houses being
usually of one story and extended over a
liberal area, as must needs be to shelter its
thousand or so of people. They are quite
up-to-date farmers, these Islete&ntilde;os, and the
pueblo is as busy at harvest time as a beehive,
what with fruit drying, corn husking,
and alfalfa baling.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> Their homes are
generally neatly kept, often adorned within
with bright-colored blankets, pretty water
ollas, and the whitewashed walls hung with
pictures of Virgin and saints&mdash;impressing
you as homes of a thrifty and well-doing
race. Indeed these people are reputed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
richest of all the Pueblos. It is, I believe,
a matter of record that in 1862, when a
detachment of the United States army was
stranded penniless in New Mexico, an Isleta
Indian loaned it $18,000 cash, simply taking
the commander&rsquo;s receipt as evidence.
After waiting patiently for twelve years
for the government to have the politeness
to return the money without being asked
for it, and hearing nothing, he and the
governor of Isleta, accompanied by the local
United States Indian agent, made a trip to
Washington to see about it. Through the
personal interest of President Grant, the
money was at last returned.</p>
<p>On August 28, St. Augustine&rsquo;s Day,
occurs the annual public fiesta, with the
usual open air Indian dances after mass
in the church. The large circular <i>estufa</i>,
or native ceremonial chamber, entered by a
ladder let down through an opening in the
roof, is a conspicuous feature of the pueblo.
You will find such places, in one form or
another, in all the Pueblo villages, and in
the Cliff Dwellers&rsquo; towns. They were
originally used as the sleeping apartments
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
of the men. Nowadays the men sleep at
home, but the <i>estufas</i> are still resorted to
by them as a sort of club-room or lounge
when religious ceremonies are not going
on inside. Despite membership in the
Roman Catholic Church the average Pueblo&rsquo;s
main hold on the unseen that is eternal
is through his primitive pagan faith, whose
rites he still practices. Entrance to the
<i>estufas</i> is not, as a rule, readily granted
to white people, and should never be undertaken
without permission first obtained.
As a matter of fact, there is on ordinary
occasions nothing to see but a dimly lighted
chamber with bare floor and walls, and a
small, boxed-in fire-pit near the base of the
ladder.</p>
<p>To the big old adobe church of Saint
Augustine in the center of the pueblo, there
attaches a queer legend sure to delight the
traveler whose interest is less in historical
verities than in the fanciful flights of the
human mind. I refer to the tradition of
the Rising of Padre Padilla&rsquo;s Coffin. Among
the Franciscan friars who accompanied
Coronado on his famous march to what he
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
called Quivira&mdash;the country of the Wichita
Indians in Kansas&mdash;was Padre Juan de
Padilla. This intrepid servant of God
(when Coronado turned homeward), remained
with two lay brothers on the Kansas
plains with the view of Christianizing those
Indians. The outcome of the matter was
that he was killed by them on November
30, 1544. Now tradition has it that somehow
in the heavenly ordering, the body of
the martyred padre got miraculously transferred
from Kansas to a place under the
church altar at Isleta; and it is firmly believed
(and the belief is backed up by the
circumstantial testimony of solid citizens)
that periodically the coffin, which is a section
of a hollowed cottonwood trunk, rises
plainly to view in the church, disclosing to
whomsoever may then be present, the padre
rather mummified but still in his black
whiskers. To prove it there are people who
will show you bits of his gown nipped off
surreptitiously by eye-witnesses and preserved
as precious amulets.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Northward from Albuquerque for 40
miles, the beautiful valley of the Rio Grande
contains much of appeal to the student of
history and of Indian life. That is the
region called in the chronicle of Coronado&rsquo;s
expedition, the Province of Tig&uuml;ex (pronounced
<i>tee-wesh</i>); and here that doughty
conquistador spent his first New Mexican
winter (1540-41) at a pueblo now vanished,
in the neighborhood, it is believed, of the
picturesque town of Bernalillo<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> 17 miles
north of Albuquerque. It was a winter so
marked with wanton deeds of deviltry by
the soldiery towards the peaceably disposed
natives, that the whole region was soon
seething in revolt&mdash;but helpless revolt because
of the guns and horses of those profligate
swashbucklers, who disgraced the
Christianity they professed.</p>
<p>Several pueblos are still extant in that
stretch. There is Sandia, a moribund little
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
place 10 miles from Albuquerque, and within
walking distance of Alameda Station on the
railway, but hardly worth the trip. North
of Bernalillo a couple of miles is a summer
pueblo, Ranchitos de Santa Ana (the little
farms of Santa Ana), occupied during the
growing season by Indians whose home
pueblo, Santa Ana, is a dozen miles to the
northwest in a virtual desert overlooking
the saline flats of the Jemes River. Thither
they go to dwell in winter and eat up the
crops raised in summer beside the great
river. In the same direction 13 miles beyond
Santa Ana (25 from Bernalillo) is the
important pueblo of the Jemes (<i>Hay&acute;-mes</i>)
Indians, about 500 in number.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> The
village is beautifully situated at the mouth
of San Diego Ca&ntilde;on. Its public fiesta is
held on St. James&rsquo;s Day, November 12, and
is much attended by Americans, Mexicans,
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
Pueblos, Navajos and Apaches. The region
nearby is sprinkled with ruins of old
pueblos which are the subject of considerable
literature of the antiquarian sort. A
capital and reliable popular article on the
Jemes Indians by Mr. A. B. Reagan, appeared
in the April, 1917, issue of &ldquo;El
Palacio,&rdquo; the journal of the Archaeological
Society of New Mexico. A few miles before
reaching Jemes the traveler passes the
once powerful, but now small pueblo of
Sia (<i>See-a</i>), with a population of barely
100. Its decline is attributed in part to remorseless
inter-killing on suspicion of witchcraft,
a sort of superstition that the Pueblos,
unlike ourselves, have not yet outgrown.
Its festival is on August 15, the Feast of
the Assumption of Our Lady, and is attended
by many visiting Indians, especially Navajos,
who give it a special tinge of picturesqueness.
From Albuquerque Jemes may be
reached directly by auto-mail stage which
passes the pueblo and then proceeds 13
miles further to Jemes Springs postoffice in
San Diego Ca&ntilde;on. Near this place are some
medicinal springs of local repute&mdash;iron, soda
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
and sulphur&mdash;and a modest hotel of the
country sort. The stage leaves Albuquerque
daily except Sunday, and if you do not
mind a bit of roughing it, the trip (about
50 miles to Jemes pueblo) will be an experience
to talk about.</p>
<p>Continuing up the Rio Grande from
Bernalillo, you next come (10 miles from
Bernalillo, or 3 from Algodones Station on
the Santa Fe) to the pueblo of San Felipe
at the foot of a long, black, treeless mesa
on the west bank of the river. Its fine,
white Mission church, dating back some 200
years, is a prominent sight from the car
windows of Santa Fe trains. The ruins of
a previous church and pueblo of the San
Felipe&ntilde;os are visible on the summit of the
mesa, and a climb to them will reward you,
at least with a fine view of the Rio Grande
valley. San Felipe&rsquo;s principal public fiesta
is held May 1.</p>
<p>Another dozen miles up the river&mdash;but
now on the east side&mdash;is the pueblo of Santo
Domingo, whose 800 Indians are about the
most set-in-their-ways of any in New
Mexico. This conservatism serves, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
to make their Green Corn Dance (held
on August 4, the feast day of their patron
Saint Dominic), of especial worth, because
the ceremony has been comparatively little
debased by the hybrid innovations which
are spoiling many of the native rites of the
Pueblos. There are some preliminary ceremonies
the afternoon before, which it is
interesting to view. The pueblo is easily
reached, as it is but a couple of miles from
Domingo station on the Santa Fe railway.
The visitor is forewarned that there is a
particularly strong objection at Santo
Domingo to picture-taking and cameras are
blacklisted. Even artists of the brush have
been ejected from the village. In passing,
it should be stated that the dances of the
Pueblos are not jollifications as among white
people, but religious ceremonials&mdash;expressions
of thanksgiving to their supernal
protectors for blessings received and prayers
for favors to come, as rain and bountiful
crops. Santo Domingo is famous for its
beautiful pottery&mdash;a heavy ware, but remarkable
for an almost Greek grace of
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
form, adorned with geometric designs in
black on pink or creamy white.</p>
<p>Still ascending the Rio Grande, you
reach (by a pleasant drive of 10 miles from
Domingo Station) the pueblo of Cochit&iacute;
(<i>co-chee-te&eacute;</i>), where the ethnologist Bandelier
once lived for a time, and studied the
race he came to know so well. It has more
the appearance of a Mexican village than
of an Indian pueblo, for the houses are
generally of one story and detached one
from another. The people, too (there are
about 250), seem more or less Mexicanized,
but are hospitable and good-natured. The
local tradition is that it was the ancestors of
the Cochite&ntilde;os who occupied the cliff dwellings
of the Rito de los Frijoles. One who
is robust enough for horseback tours may
secure a guide at Cochit&iacute; and ascend to that
wild and beautiful region by immemorial
trails through a rugged mountain country
dotted with ruins of several former homes
and shrines of the Cochit&iacute; people, who in
prehistoric times seem to have been confirmed
wanderers. The principal public
fiesta at this pueblo occurs on July 14, Saint
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
Bonaventure&rsquo;s Day, and is well worth attending,
though I know of no especial features
distinguishing it. Pottery is made
here, too&mdash;some of it of a queer type running
to animal forms, corpulent and impossible.
Both Cochit&iacute; and Santo Domingo
may be readily visited in one day, if arrangements
are made in advance through
the Santa Fe agent at Domingo. They are
equally easy of access from Santa Fe and
Albuquerque.</p>

<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE DEAD CITIES OF THE SALINES</span></h2>
<p>Southeasterly from Albuquerque some 20
miles the Manzano Mountains lift their piny
crests and drift southward to the Gallinas.
From their feet eastward stretches the wide
treeless Estancia Valley, and in the lap of
it lies a noteworthy cluster of saline ponds
and lagoons, whose bitter waters, shining
in the blistering sun, are a mockery to the
thirsty. These are &ldquo;the accursed lakes&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a>
of Pueblo tradition&mdash;originally fresh and
abounding in fish, they say, but now lifeless
and undrinkable, cursed of the ancient gods
because of the sinfulness of a witch who
dwelt there once. If you would know how
this change came about, you should read the
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
tale called &ldquo;The Accursed Lake&rdquo; in Mr.
Charles F. Lummis&rsquo;s delightful book &ldquo;Pueblo
Indian Folk Stories.&rdquo; These lakes are
all heavily alkaline except one and that is
saline&mdash;a source of salt from time immemorial
to the Indians of the pueblos. Coming
from near and far, they would plant
their prayer plumes by its white margin
and sprinkle its waves with sacred meal in
recognition of the divine largesse they were
about to receive. For the Indian tradition
is that this lake was the abode of a divinity
whom they called Salt Old Woman or Salt
Mother, and the salt was her free gift to
men. She is circumstantially described as
wearing white boots and a white cotton
dress, and carrying in her hand a white
abalone shell, which was so soft and pliable
that she could fold it like a handkerchief.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a>
It is said the salt of this lake has found its
way through barter to Parral in Old Mexico.</p>
<p>To the tourist the attraction in the Estancia
Valley is the presence of some quaint
old plaza villages dating from the days of
the Spanish occupation, and certain imposing
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
ruins of Franciscan Mission churches of
seventeenth century construction standing
in the midst of crumbled Pueblo towns.
These are not in the open valley but in the
foothills of the Manzanos and the Gallinas,
and are easily visited from Mountainair, an
American town on the &ldquo;Bel&eacute;n Cut-off&rdquo; of
the Santa Fe Railway. Here is a small hotel,
and automobiles may be hired.</p>
<p>The most famous of the ruins is the Gran
Quivira at the edge of the Gallinas foothills,
24 miles south of Mountainair. They are
the remains of a large pueblo of low, stone
houses, covering altogether about 80 acres
and once housing perhaps a couple of thousand
souls. There are the ruins of several
<i>estufas</i>, of irrigation works, and of two
Christian churches. The pueblo occupies the
narrow crest of a ridge overlooking a vast,
lonely, cedar- and pi&ntilde;on-dotted plain that
reaches to far-off, dreamy mountain ranges.
It is in a solitude of solitudes wrapped in
the silence of death, and as almost everywhere
in the plateau region of northern
New Mexico and Arizona, one has the feeling
of being alone on the roof of the world,
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
though the elevation here is really but 6800
feet. The most conspicuous feature of this
shattered town is the larger of the two
churches whose gaunt, gray, roofless walls
of flat limestone pieces laid in mortar and
rising to a height of 30 feet, are visible to
the traveler long before he reaches the place.
Seen &ldquo;from the northeast, through vistas of
cedars and junipers,&rdquo; to quote Bandelier,
&ldquo;the ruins shine in pallid light like some
phantom city of the desert.&rdquo; Adjoining
the church, are the ruins of a <i>convento</i> of
several small rooms and a refectory, built
about an interior courtyard. The whole
has an unfinished appearance, and Bandelier
believed that work on the building was
suddenly interrupted and never resumed.</p>
<p>Indeed, the whole place is shrouded in
mystery&mdash;its beginning and its end are alike
in the twilight. No record has been left by
the old chroniclers of any mission called
Gran Quivira; but there is frequent mention
by them of Tabir&aacute;, whose location
fairly corresponds to this. That was a town
of the Piro Pueblos, where an important
Mission was established about 1630 by Padre
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
Francisco de Acevedo. It ceased to be heard
of after half a century, and it is believed
that repeated raids of the barbarous Apaches&mdash;the
red terror of the peacable Pueblos&mdash;caused
the abandonment of the village. In
all human probability that Tabir&aacute; is this
Gran Quivira, but how the latter name became
attached to these ruins has never been
satisfactorily explained; for, as has already
been stated, Quivira was Coronado&rsquo;s name
for the country of the Wichitas, far away
in Kansas. The Piro people, who are believed
to have inhabitated this pueblo (and
that of Ab&oacute;, of which something shortly),
are about as extinct as their towns. Only
an insignificant remnant, and these speaking
an alien tongue, exist today, in the
Mexican State of Chihuahua.</p>
<p>The hill which the Gran Quivira ruins
occupy is of limestone, and underlaid, as
limestone hills often are, with hollownesses
that give back in places an audible echo to
one&rsquo;s footfalls. Popular fancy has been
caught by these givings-off of the underworld,
and all sorts of fables have attached
themselves to this desolate place. These have
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
mostly to do with buried treasure. It has
been thought, for instance, that here in the
caverns of this hill is really the store of
gold and jewels, the hope of which, like a
will-of-the-wisp, lured Coronado on and
ever on, to disappointment and a broken
heart. Another tradition (quoted by Mr.
Paul A. F. Walter, in &ldquo;The Cities That
Died of Fear&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a>) tells of a hidden cave in
the hill where the last Piros are said to
have retreated with their belongings, including
vast treasure brought from Mexico
by the Franciscan Fathers,<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> and that an
earthquake sealed them and their treasure
up together. Of course, such stories have
brought hither innumerable treasure seekers,
who for years have gophered the hill industriously
but have got nothing but sore
muscles, arrowheads, and broken pottery.
The most picturesque of these delvers was
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
a blind woman, a Mrs. Clara Corbyn, who
acquired homestead rights on the north end
of Gran Quivira. Lacking the wherewithal to
finance excavations, she traveled the country
over from the Pacific to the Atlantic, endeavoring
to procure money backing for her
scheme, and to that end even wrote a musical
romance, which she called &ldquo;La Gran Quivira.&rdquo;
Failing, she died not long ago in
Los Angeles&mdash;of a broken heart, it is said&mdash;and
the Museum of New Mexico eventually
secured her homestead interest.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> The
major portion of these ruins belongs to the
United States, forming the Gran Quivira
National Monument.</p>
<p>Ab&oacute;, that other dead pueblo of the Piros,
is about 12 miles southwest of Mountainair,
or 4 miles west of Ab&oacute; station on the Santa
Fe Railway. Gran Quivira you see on its
hilltop for miles before you reach it, but of
Ab&oacute; your first view comes with the shock of
an unexpected delight. Your car climbs a
hill through a bit of wooded wilderness, and,
the crest attained, there flashes on your
sight from below, an exquisite little sunlit
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
valley. In the midst of it is a hillock, and
on and about this is scattered the desolated,
roofless pueblo with its noble church, ruined
too, of San Gregorio de Ab&oacute;. A thread of
living water&mdash;the Arroyo de Ab&oacute;&mdash;cuts its
way through the valley which is bounded
on the west by the lovely chain of the
Manzanos. Unfortunately, the ruin of the
old church still goes on&mdash;the decay hastened,
I believe, by the fact that latter-day settlers
have borne off much of its stone and timber
for their private use. As it now stands, the
high, jagged walls of the building resemble
as much as anything a gigantic broken
tooth, and standing in this solitary place are
picturesque to a degree. The material is
red sandstone and the edifice dates from
about 1630&mdash;the founder being the same
Padre de Acevedo that is credited with establishing
Gran Quivira. He died here at
Ab&oacute;, and was buried in the church on
August 1, 1644. This pueblo, like Gran
Quivira, is believed to have been abandoned
because of Apache raids, and was extinct
before the great rebellion of 1680.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>A few miles from the old pueblo, and
close to the railway line there are some
low cliffs, forming one side of a gorge once
called <i>El Ca&ntilde;on de la Pintada</i>, or the Painted
Rocks of Ab&oacute; Ca&ntilde;on. This spot is a sort
of aboriginal picture gallery worth a visit by
the curious in such matters. The sheltered
places on the cliff-face are adorned for a
considerable distance with drawings of
evident antiquity in various colors&mdash;yellow,
green, red, white. They are mostly representative
of human figures, one or two apparently
of the clowns who play prankish
parts in many of the present-day Pueblo
ceremonies. Others are symbols that still
survive in the religious rites of the
Pueblos.</p>
<p>Eight miles northwest of Mountainair
(and a little more due north of Ab&oacute;) is
Quara&iacute;, another forsaken pueblo, the ruins
of whose fine old Mission church may be
seen a mile away. My own first view of it
was dramatic enough, the red, sandstone
walls 20 feet high or more, gaunt and jagged,
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
silhouetted sharply against a sky black
with storm clouds whence rain banners wavered
downward, and athwart them now
and then forked lightnings shot and spit.
Quara&iacute; was a walled town, and some excavation
work, done recently by the Santa Fe
archaeologists, has brought to light among
other things the remains of a round community
building resembling the Tyuonyi in
the Ca&ntilde;on Rito de los Frijoles.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> Close at
hand is a cottonwood grove refreshed by
an abundant spring, a favorite picnic ground
for the country folk roundabout. Other
ruins in the vicinity and signs of ancient
fields here and there indicate that Quara&iacute;
was a place of importance in its day, and
doubtless for a long time before the Spanish
occupation. Its church is believed to
have been built about 1628 and was dedicated
to La Inmaculada Concepcion. This
was the Mission of that Padre de la Llana
whose remains, after much travel, are now
at rest beneath the altar in the Cathedral at
Santa Fe.</p>
<p>About 7 miles northward from Quara&iacute;,
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
nestling at the foot of Manzano Peak,<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> is
an excellent example of the old-fashioned
plaza village, called Manzano, which is
Spanish for apple tree. The reason for the
name is the presence there of a couple of
ancient apple orchards, which are believed
to date back to the time of the Franciscan
Missions, and doubtless were set out by the
Fathers of Quara&iacute;, some 250 years ago.
The village is of the typical adobe architecture
of New Mexico, and though not so
old as it looks, having been settled about
1825, it is very foreign of aspect. With its
plaza, its old-fashioned flowers in the gardens,
its houses massed one above another
on the side of a hill that is topped by a
great wooden cross, its murmurous <i>ac&eacute;quia</i>,
and its fine old Spanish <i>torreon</i> or tower
of defense, Manzano holds features of picturesqueness
enough to be worth a trip in
itself. A unique feature of the place is the
Manzano Lake which occupies a depression
in the midst of the village&mdash;a charming sheet
of water, beautiful and fragrant in season
with water lilies. The source of the Lake
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
is a magnificent spring hardby. To reach
it, one climbs the hillside a quarter-mile or
so, and then descends into a shaded hollow,
where the cool water gushes up into a colossal
bowl, and brimming over quickly sinks
into the ground to re-appear below and form
the village lake. The spring is locally
known as <i>El Ojo del Gigante</i>&mdash;the Giant&rsquo;s
Eye&mdash;and is famed throughout the State
as a very marvel among springs.</p>
<p>If one have time and inclination, the
Estancia Valley, its lakes and ruins and
Mexican villages may be made the objective
of a trip by automobile from Santa Fe or
Albuquerque. The roads in good weather
are fair, as unimproved roads go, and in
the mountain part pass through a wooded
region of much loveliness&mdash;sunny park-like
forests of pine and oak, with numerous
rivulets and charming wild gardens. From
Albuquerque to Mountainair by this route
is about 75 miles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">OF ACOMA, CITY OF THE MARVELLOUS ROCK, AND LAGUNA</span></h2>
<p>The oldest occupied town in the United
States, and in point of situation perhaps the
most poetic, is Acoma (<i>ah&acute;co-ma</i>), occupying
the flat summit of a huge rock mass
whose perpendicular sides rise 350 feet out
of a solitary New Mexican plain.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> It is
situated 15 miles southwest of the Santa
Fe Railway station of Laguna, where modest
accommodations are provided for travelers
who stop over. The inhabitants of
Acoma, numbering about 700, are Pueblo
Indians, whose ancestors founded this rockborne
town before the white history of the
Southwest began. Coronado found it here
in 1540. <i>El Pe&ntilde;ol Maravilloso</i>&mdash;the Rock
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
Marvellous&mdash;the old chroniclers called it.
&ldquo;A city the strangest and strongest,&rdquo; says
Padre Benavides, writing of it in 1630, &ldquo;that
there can be in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They will take you from Laguna to
Acoma in an automobile over a road, little
better than a trail, whose traversability depends
more or less on weather conditions
not only that day, but the day before.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> It
winds through a characteristic bit of central
New Mexico landscape, breezy, sunlit and
long-vistaed, treeless save for scattering
pi&ntilde;on and juniper. Wild flowers bespangle
the ground in season; and mountains&mdash;red,
purple, amethystine, weather-worn into a
hundred fantastic shapes&mdash;rise to view on
every hand. In July and August the afternoon
sky customarily becomes massed with
cloud clusters, and local showers descend
in long, wavering bands of darkness&mdash;here
one, there another. Traveling yourself in
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
sunshine beneath an island of clear turquoise
in such a stormy sky, you may count
at one time eight or ten of these picturesque
streamers of rain on the horizon circle.
Jagged lightnings play in one quarter of the
heavens while broken rainbows illumine
others. Nowhere else in our country is the
sky so very much alive as in New Mexico
and Arizona in summer. Nowhere else, I
think, as in this land of fantastic rock
forms, of deep blue skies, and of wide,
golden, sunlit plains, do you feel so much
like an enchanted traveler in a Maxfield
Parrish picture.</p>
<p>Though the cliffs of Acoma are visible
for several miles before you reach the Rock,
you are almost at its base before you distinguish
any sign of the village&mdash;the color
of its terraced houses being much the same
as that of the mesa upon which they are
set. The soft rocky faces have been cut
into grotesque shapes by the sand of the
plain which the winds of ages have been
picking up and hurling against them. There
are strange helmeted columns, slender minarets
and spires that some day perhaps a
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
tempest will snap in two, dark, cool caverns
which your fancy pictures as dens of those
ogreish divinities you have read of Indians&rsquo;
believing in.</p>
<p>Your first adventure at Acoma&mdash;and it is
a joyous one&mdash;is climbing the Rock to the
village on top. There are several trails.
One is broad and easy, whereby the Pueblo
flocks come up from the plains to be folded
for the night, and men ahorseback travel.
Shorter is the one your Indian guide will
take you, by a gradual sandy ascent, to the
base of the cliff. There you are face to
face with a crevice up which you ascend
by an all but perpendicular aboriginal stairway
of stone blocks and boulders piled
upward in the crack. Handholes cut in the
rock wall support you over ticklish places,
until finally you clamber out upon the flat
summit. In Coronado&rsquo;s time you would
have been confronted there by a wall of
loose stones which the Acomas had built to
roll down on the heads of the unwelcome.
Today, instead, the visitor is apt to be
greeted by an official of the pueblo exacting
a head-tax of a dollar for the privilege of
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
seeing the town, and picture-taking extra!</p>
<p>I think this precipitous trail is the one
known as <i>El Camino del Padre</i> (the Father&rsquo;s
Way), which is associated with a pretty
bit of history. The first permanent Christian
missionary at Acoma was the Franciscan
Juan Ramirez. Now the Acomas had
never been friendly to the Spaniards, and
it was only after a three days&rsquo; hard battle
in 1599, resulting in the capture and burning
of the town by the Spaniards, that the
Indians accepted vassalage to that inexplicable
king beyond the sea.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> Naturally, no
friendly feeling was engendered by this
episode; so when this Padre Ramirez, years
afterward, was seen approaching the Rock
one day&mdash;it was in 1629&mdash;quite alone and
unarmed save with cross and breviary (having
walked all the way from Santa Fe, a
matter of 175 miles) the Acomas decided
to make short work of him. The unsuspecting
father started briskly up the rocky
stairway, and when he came within easy
range, the watching Indians shot their arrows
at him. Then a remarkable thing happened.
A little girl, one of a group looking
over the edge of the precipice, lost her
balance and fell out of sight apparently to
her death. A few minutes later, the undaunted
padre whom the shelter of the
cliff had saved from the arrows, appeared
at the head of the trail holding in his
arms the little child smiling and quite unharmed.
Unseen by the Indians, she had
lit on a shelving bit of rock from which
the priest had tenderly lifted her. So
obvious a miracle completely changed the
Indians&rsquo; feelings towards the long-gowned
stranger, and he remained for many years,
teaching his dusky wards Spanish and so
much of Christian doctrine as they would
assimilate. It was this Fray Juan Ramirez,
it is said, who had built the animal trail
which has been mentioned.</p>

<p class="caption">LAGUNA, THE MOTHER PUEBLO OF SEVEN</p>
<p class="caption">This pueblo, languishing while neighboring Acoma flourished, borrowed the latter&rsquo;s picture of
St. Joseph to change her fortune, prospered accordingly, and then refused to return the picture,
thus precipitating a lawsuit unique in our annals.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Most visitors spend a couple of hours at
Acoma, and return the same day to the railroad.
This, at a pinch, suffices for a ramble
about the streets, and for looking into doorways
for glimpses of the primitive family
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
life, chaffering with the women for the
pretty pottery for which Acoma is famed,<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a>
and for a visit to the natural rock cisterns
whence girls are continually coming with
dripping ollas balanced on their heads. And
of course, there is the old adobe church
with its balconied <i>convento</i>, to be seen. It
dates from about 1700. As the Rock was
bare of building material, this had all to be
brought up from below on the backs of
Indian neophytes&mdash;the timbers from the
mountains 20 miles away. The graveyard
is a remarkable piece of work founded on
the sloping rock by building retaining walls
of stone (40 feet high, at the outer end)
and filling in with sandy earth lugged patiently
up from the plain.</p>
<p>A conspicuous feature in the view from
the Rock of Acoma is a solitary mesa or
rock-table, 3 miles to the northward, which
the Acomas call Katz&iacute;mo, and the Spaniards
named <i>La Mesa Encantada</i> (the Enchanted
Mesa). Its flat top is 430 perpendicular
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
feet above the plain, and can now
be reached only with scaling ladders and
ropes. Formerly there was a single trail
up the side. The Indian tradition is that
long, long ago, before the coming of the
white invaders, the village of the Acomas
occupied the summit. One day, while all
the population except a few old people were
working in the fields below, a tempest completely
swept away the upper part of the
trail; so that the inhabitants could never
again reach their homes. They began life
over again by building a new pueblo on
the Rock of Acoma.<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a></p>
<p>The annual public fiesta of Acoma is held
September 2, the day of San Est&eacute;ban Rey&mdash;that
is, of St. Stephen the King, Acoma&rsquo;s
patron saint and Hungary&rsquo;s. It is attended
by a picturesque crowd of Mexicans, Navajos
and Pueblos, besides a sprinkling of
Americans. Among the visitors are thrifty
Islete&ntilde;os, their farm wagons loaded with
melons, grapes and peaches for sale and
barter. As on all such occasions in the Rio
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
Grande pueblos, there is first a great clanging
of the church bells to get the people to
mass; after which, the saint&rsquo;s statue beneath
a canopy is brought out from the church,
and all the people march in procession behind
it, the cross, and the padre, while to
the accompaniment of a solemn chant the
firing of guns and a wild clamor of discordant
church bells, the image is carried to a
booth of green boughs in the plaza, there
to rest and receive the homage of the people.
Throughout the day baskets heaped
with fruit, loaves of bread, vegetables and
candles are laid at the saint&rsquo;s feet, and at
intervals the edibles are handed out to the
crowd, or tossed in the air to be scrambled
for amid much hilarity. In the afternoon
there is an Indian dance, participated in by
men and women in colorful costumes, the
women&rsquo;s heads adorned with <i>tablitas</i>
(curious, painted boards set upright and
cut into shapes symbolic of clouds and what
not). A choir of men with a drum made
of a section of cottonwood log, supplies the
music, chanting in unison the ancient songs
of thanksgiving efficacious long before St.
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
Stephen was ever heard of in Acoma, and
not to be lightly abandoned. At sundown
the saint is returned to his place in the
church, and the evening is given over to
such jollity as personal fancy dictates,
usually including a <i>baile</i>, or dance, by the
Mexicans and such white folk as stay, and it
must be confessed, too often a surreptitious
bout with John Barleycorn smuggled in by
bootleggers.</p>
<p>There are no accommodations for visitors
at Acoma, but if you have a taste for mild
adventure you will enjoy&mdash;in retrospect
anyhow&mdash;lodging a night or two with some
family in the village, if you have brought
your own provisions. This gives you a
leisurely opportunity to watch the people
at their daily tasks, and to enjoy the exquisite
outlook at evening and early morning
from the Rock. A night on an Acoma
housetop beneath the brilliant stars is like
being transported to Syria. Take it as a
rule that if you desire to learn anything
worth while of Indian life, you must abandon
hurry; and the more you pump an
Indian, the less he will tell you. The best
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
things in the Southwest come to the waiting
traveler, not to the hustler. As to the
language, in every pueblo there is someone
who talks English enough to act as interpreter,
but if you know a little Spanish, you
may do without any intermediary in the
Rio Grande villages.</p>
<p>The natural pendant to a visit to Acoma
is one to Laguna pueblo, 2 miles from the
station of the same name.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> Like Acoma, it
is built upon a rock, but Laguna&rsquo;s is merely
a low outcropping little above the level of
the ground. The pueblo is full of picturesque
bits, and the fall and rise of the streets
continually give you skyey silhouettes, the
delight of artists who like liberal foregrounds.
The mature coloring of the houses
in time-mellowed, pearly tones, coupled with
the fact that the old trail leading from the
outskirts of the pueblo to the spring is worn
deep in the rock floor by the wear of generations
of moccasined feet, gives one the impression
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
that Laguna is of great antiquity.
Nevertheless, it is not, having been founded
about 1697. In 1699 it received its name
San Jos&eacute; de la Laguna&mdash;Saint Joseph of
the Lake&mdash;the appropriateness of which is
not now apparent as there is no lake there.
In those days, however, there was a lagoon
nearby, due largely to the damming of
the little River San Jos&eacute; by beavers. English
is very generally spoken in this pueblo.</p>
<p>Some 60 years ago Laguna was the defendant
in a curious lawsuit brought against
it by Acoma. Fray Juan Ramirez&mdash;he of
the <i>Camino del Padre</i>&mdash;had put Acoma
under the patronage of Saint Joseph, spouse
of Our Lady and patron of the Church
Universal, and in the Acoma church the
saint&rsquo;s picture hung for many years, a
source of local blessing as the Acomas
firmly believed. Now while Acoma prospered
Laguna had many misfortunes&mdash;crop
failures, sickness and so on; and with a
view to bettering matters Laguna asked
Acoma for the loan of Saint Joseph. This
request was granted with the understanding
that the loan should be for one month only.
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
But alas, recreant Laguna, once in possession,
refused to give back the picture, which
was proving as &ldquo;good medicine&rdquo; there as
had been the case at Acoma. At last the
padre was called on to settle the dispute and
he suggested that lots be drawn for it. This
was done and the picture fell to Acoma.
The Lagunas proved poor losers, however,
and made off with the painting by force&mdash;which
enraged the Acomas to the fighting
point, and war was only averted by the
padre&rsquo;s persuading them to do what a Pueblo
Indian is very loth to do, submit the
case to the white man&rsquo;s courts. Lawyers
were engaged by both pueblos, and after
a hot wrangle involving an appeal to the
Supreme Court of New Mexico, the picture
was awarded to Acoma. Evidently the saint
himself approved the judgment, for tradition
has it that when the Acoma delegation
appointed to fetch the picture back were
half way to Laguna, their astonished eyes
were greeted by the sight of it reposing
under a mesquite bush. Evidently, upon
receipt of the news, it had set out of its
own accord for home!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>In proof of which the traveler today
may see the painting in the old church at
Acoma.<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></p>
<p>Laguna&rsquo;s principal public fiesta is held
annually on September 18, and adds to the
usual ceremonies of the saint&rsquo;s day at a
pueblo the features of a country fair, for
the Lagunas are notable agriculturists. The
Mission church interior at Laguna, by the
way, possesses features of interest in the
way of Indian decoration and ancient Spanish
paintings, particularly those of the altar
done on stretched hide. Visitors may be
accommodated in Indian houses, if they
court that experience, or at the residence
of a Protestant missionary near by. The
National Old Trails transcontinental highway
passes the pueblo.</p>

<br /><span class="small">TO ZU&Ntilde;I, THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, VIA GALLUP</span></h2>
<p>Gallup, New Mexico, has never made
much of a stir as a tourist center, but like
many a spot of modest pretensions, it is
deserving beyond its gettings. As an example
of the &ldquo;city beautiful&rdquo; it is not, in
my judgment, a success; but as a base and
a fitting-out point for some of the most
interesting parts of the Southwest, it is to
be heartily commended.<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> Particularly is
this so now that the motor car has so largely
supplanted the horse-drawn vehicle for excursions
afield. There are comfortable hotel
accommodations and there are Harvey
meals obtainable.</p>

<p>From Gallup (which is
on one of the main automobile routes followed by transcontinental motorists) good
trips radiate in many directions&mdash;85 miles
to Ca&ntilde;on de Chelly, for instance, and its
cliff dwellings amidst surpassing scenery;
75 miles to the Pueblo Bonito ruins in Chaco
Ca&ntilde;on; 125 miles to the Hopi country; 42
miles to Zu&ntilde;i pueblo; 75 miles to Inscription
Rock of the Conquistadores. The great
Navajo reservation with its picturesque
aboriginal life reaches almost to Gallup&rsquo;s
back door, and even the Mesa Verde National
Park,<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a>
can be done from Gallup in
4 or 5 days for the round trip, if the weather
conditions are right.</p>
<p>This chapter has to do with the famous
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
Indian pueblo of Zu&ntilde;i, which lies to the
south, about 2&frac12; hours by motor car. The
road is all sorts from a motorist&rsquo;s standpoint;
so be your own best friend and take
it good-naturedly, for fussing will not mend
it. In a few minutes you are beyond sight
of houses and railroads, and in a twinkling
Time&rsquo;s clock has whirled back a couple of
centuries. You pass, perhaps, a Navajo
woman astride her pony, a sheepskin or two
tied to the saddle, on her way to the trader&rsquo;s
for coffee and tobacco; and then a Mexican
teamster crouching over a bit of camp-fire
where his chili and beans are stewing, his
wagon piled high with wool sacks drawn
up by the roadside. Now a solitary adobe
ranch house, or a lone trader&rsquo;s log hut is
seen in a wilderness of sagey plain; and now
a flock of sheep drift into the road out of
the pi&ntilde;on- and cedar-scrub, a couple of
bright-eyed Navajo children shepherding in
their wake. By and by you pass another
sort of Indian on horseback, a slightly built
man with long jet-black hair lifted by the
breeze, a red <i>banda</i> encircling it&mdash;he is a
Zu&ntilde;i. And then topping a low hill, you are
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
greeted by the distant sight of a long flat-topped
mesa, creamy pink against a blue
sky. It is Towa-y&aacute;lleni, Zu&ntilde;i&rsquo;s Mountain
of the Sacred Corn. A turn in the road,
and the great yellow plain of Zu&ntilde;i spreads
out before you, the Zu&ntilde;i River threading
its midst, and on its bank the old pueblo
humps itself like a huge anthill, hardly
distinguishable in color from the plain
itself.</p>
<p>Zu&ntilde;i (with a population of some 1600)
is historically perhaps the most interesting
of all the Pueblo towns, for it is the present-day
representative of those Seven Cities of
C&iacute;bola, the fable of whose wealth led to the
discovery of New Mexico in the sixteenth
century. There really were seven Zu&ntilde;i villages
in Coronado&rsquo;s time, all of which have
long since disappeared, though sites of at
least five are known. The present Zu&ntilde;i
pueblo seems to have been built about the
year 1700, replacing that one of the ancient
seven known as H&aacute;lona. This occupied the
opposite or south bank of the river in
Coronado&rsquo;s time&mdash;a spot now partially covered
by the buildings of a white trader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>If you are going to hold your car and
return to Gallup the same day, there will
probably be 3 or 4 hours available for a
stroll about the pueblo. The houses, of a
characteristic reddish tone, rise from one-storied
structures on the outskirts to 5
stories at the center of the town, and you
will enjoy mounting by ladders and stepping
stones to that uppermost height for
the lovely view over the plain to the mountains
that hem in the Zu&ntilde;i valley. The
narrow streets without sidewalks open out
now and then into small plazas, and some
communicate with one another by tunnels.
Beehive ovens squat upon the roofs in dome-like
fashion and contribute a suggestion of
the Orient&mdash;of Cairo or Syria. Dogs,
turkeys, pigs and burros have equal right
with humanity in the cramped thoroughfares,
and if one is of a cleanly habit, one
needs to watch one&rsquo;s steps. But dirt and
picturesqueness were ever comrades, and
Zu&ntilde;i is truly picturesque. From the open
door issues the hum of the busy mealing
stones, and the fragrance of the crushed
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
corn; perhaps, too, to your ravished ears,
the high-keyed melody of grinding songs
shrilled by the women as they work.</p>
<p>Look in, and if your manner is respectful
and the girls not over shy, you will be
allowed the enjoyment of a charming picture
of kneeling, swaying bodies and of
down-turned faces veiled in falling hair.
Ollas of native ware stand about with
water; parti-colored blankets of Navajo or
Zu&ntilde;i weave hanging from wall or ceiling
give a touch of brightness in the dim light
of the room; in the triangular corner fireplace
dinner simmers within a bowl of native
pottery set upon the coals. If fortune
favors you there may be a potter at her
moulding, or, in the street, jars being fired
or bread being put to bake in the adobe
ovens; or in some plaza a ceremonial dance
in costume may be in progress. Zu&ntilde;i is
still comfortably pagan&mdash;the ancient Catholic
church is a ruin and the modern Protestant
mission is by no means overworked&mdash;and
throughout the year the red gods of
Zu&ntilde;i have homage paid them in many a
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
ceremony rich in symbolism and pure
beauty.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></p>
<p>On the outskirts of the pueblo in August,
one may have a sight of wheat thrashing on
the open-air thrashing floors, the grain being
trodden out in oriental fashion by
horses, sheep or goats. Or there may be a
straight-away horse race over the plain with
a picturesque crowd looking on; or a <i>gallo</i>
race, the part of the rooster (<i>gallo</i>) humanely
taken in these latter days by a sack
buried to the neck in the sand. A quieter
feature of interest is the quaint little vegetable
gardens on a slope by the river&mdash;each
tiny garden enclosed with a thin adobe
wall. These are tended by the women who
daily bring water in ollas and pails to irrigate
the plants.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>A short walk from the pueblo brings you
to Hepatina (<i>hay&acute;-pa-tee-na</i>) a stone shrine
erected on the plain, which in the Zu&ntilde;i conception,
marks the center of the earth; for
the unreconstructed Zu&ntilde;i believes naturally
enough, just as your and my ancestors did
a few centuries ago, that the earth is flat.
Hither in the days of long ago, a guardian
divinity of the Zu&ntilde;is brought them as to
the safest place in the world&mdash;the farthest
from the edge&mdash;preceding them in the form
of a water strider. The double-barred cross,
which you will see sometimes on Zu&ntilde;i pottery,
or fashioned in silver, is the symbol
of that divine guide. There has been, by
the way, some good pottery made at Zu&ntilde;i,
and the visitor interested in that art may
still enjoy the adventure of a house-to-house
ceramic hunt with chances of a pleasurable
outcome.</p>
<p>The accommodations for visitors in the
pueblo are very limited. Perhaps one of the
couple of white resident traders or the
school teacher may be complaisant enough
to take you in; and there are certain Indian
houses where lodging can surely be had. If
you are not of a meticulous sort, I would
recommend a stop-over long enough at
least to visit the mesa Towa-y&aacute;lleni, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
Cushing has put into literature as Thunder
Mountain. It looks near the pueblo, but
is really 4 miles distant. On its summit
centuries ago there was a pueblo of the
Zu&ntilde;is, the broken down walls of which,
overrun with cactus and brush, are still
quite evident. Curious pictographs of the
ancients may be traced on many a rock; and
if one knows where to look, there are pagan
shrines where prayer plumes are yet offered
to the Divine Ones. Among such are those
of the Twin War Gods, whose home is believed
to have been on Towa-y&aacute;lleni&mdash;&ldquo;little
fellows that never give up.&rdquo; I was once informed
by a Zu&ntilde;i, &ldquo;gone away now
may be gone up, may be gone down; <i>quien
sabe</i>?&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a>
It was on this mountain the Zu&ntilde;is
found a refuge after their losing fight with
Coronado in 1540; and again in 1632 they
retreated hither after killing their missionary,
Padre Letrado, of whom we shall hear again
at Inscription Rock in the next chapter.
And here they were in 1692 when
De Vargas forced their surrender in the re-conquest.
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
Tradition has it, too, that here
long, long ago, the people fled for safety
when an offended deity flooded them out
of their villages in the plain; and the water
still rising, a desperate sacrifice was called
for. A boy and a girl were tossed from
the summit into the angry flood. In a twinkling,
the children were transformed into pinnacles of
rock and the waters sank appeased.
You can see these spires of
stone today from Zu&ntilde;i, and old people will
tell you that the one with a double point is the boy.
A peculiar virtue resides in that
petrified humanity it seems. If a childless
couple resort to the base of the pinnacles and
there plant prayer plumes, there will be granted to
them the children of their desire.</p>
<p>There are trails, steep and rough, up
Towa-y&aacute;lleni&rsquo;s sides, and if you can make
the trip with an intelligent and communicative old
Zu&ntilde;i (most of the young ones seem to know
or care little about the ancient things), you will
have a remarkable outing.
An hour or two spent on that lonely breeze-swept,
sun-kissed mesa-top, with the ruined
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
town, its broken shrines, its historic and
legendary memories, will induct you, as no
amount of reading will, into the atmosphere
of the Southwest&rsquo;s romantic past. There
used to be&mdash;and for all I know still is&mdash;a
trail that a rider on horseback can follow,
at the northeastern side of the mesa. The
ancient peach orchard through which it
wound owes its existence to seed brought
to Zu&ntilde;i by the Spaniards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Five miles northeast of Zu&ntilde;i, is Black
Rock, where travelers with an interest in Government
education of the Indians may see a
Reservation School in operation. Within a radius
of 15 or 20 miles of the main pueblo are 3 farming
villages occupied in summer by Zu&ntilde;is to be
near certain tracts of tillable land. One of these,
Ojo Caliente, 15 miles southwest of Zu&ntilde;i, is
close to the site of ancient H&aacute;wikuh&mdash;the first
Pueblo town seen by white men. Upon it in 1539,
intrepid Fray Marcos de Niza looked down from
a nearby height, and then, warned by the murder
of his avant-courier, the negro Est&eacute;vanico, beat
a prudent retreat to Mexico. Coronado captured
the place in the following year, and thence made
his first report of the famous 7 cities to the viceroy
in Mexico. It is the scene of one of the
most charming of Cushing&rsquo;s Zu&ntilde;i folk tales, &ldquo;The
Foster Child of the Deer.&rdquo; Extensive excavations
have recently been made there by Government
ethnologists.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">EL MORRO, THE AUTOGRAPH ROCK OF THE CONQUISTADORES</span></h2>
<p>Thirty-five miles eastward from Zu&ntilde;i (2
hours by automobile, if the roads are dry)
is a huge rock mass of pale pink sandstone
whose sides rise sheer a couple of hundred
feet against a turquoise sky. It stands in
the midst of a lonely plain whose wild
grasses are nibbled by the passing flocks of
wandering Navajos, and so far as I know,
there is no nearer human habitation than
the little Mormon settlement of Ramah,
through which you pass to reach the rock.
This cliff has a story to tell of such unique
interest that the United States Government
has acquired the mesa of which it is a spur
for a National Monument. It is known as
Inscription Rock, or El Morro (the latter
a not uncommon Spanish-American designation
for a bold promontory), and was a
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
landmark as early as the sixteenth century
for the Spanish expeditions bound between
Santa Fe, Acoma and Zu&ntilde;i. Water, feed,
and wood were here available, as they are
today, making the foot of the high cliff a
good camping place, and here as a matter
of fact during the sixteenth, seventeenth,
and eighteenth centuries, many a Spanish
military party did camp, and having rested
themselves and their cattle, went on refreshed
to do the errands of their King
and Church.</p>
<p>And hither one day in 1849, just after
New Mexico had become part of the United
States, came Lieut. J. H. Simpson, U. S. A.,
with some troopers on a military reconnaissance,
and discovered that the base of the
cliff was a veritable album of those old
Conquistadores; bearing not only the names
of the Spanish explorers but frequently an
accompaniment of date and comment that
form important contributory evidence
touching the early history of the Southwest.
Simpson made copies of a number of the
inscriptions, and these were published with
translations (not always accurate) in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
report to the Secretary of War.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a> Most of
those recordings carved in the soft rock
with sword or dagger point are still fresh
and legible, so little have centuries of dry
New Mexico weather worn the clear-cut
lettering. If you go to see them, you will
be a dry-as-dust indeed if you do not feel
an odd sort of thrill as you put your finger
tips upon the chiseled autographs of the
men who won for Spain an empire and held
it dauntlessly. For most of these records
are not idle scribblings of the witless, but
careful work by people with a purpose,
whose names are mentioned in the documents
of the time. Here are the names,
for instance, of O&ntilde;ate, the conqueror, and
of De Vargas, the re-conqueror, the very
flower of the warrior brotherhood. The
Rock is a monument such as has no duplicate
in the country; and some day when
our historians have got the Southwest in
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
proper perspective, and waked up to a realization
of the heroism and romance that
went into the making of it, El Morro will
perhaps be really protected (if its priceless
inscriptions survive so long) and not left
as it is now to vandal tourists to hack and
carve their silly names upon.</p>
<p>It takes knowledge of old Spanish abbreviations
to get at the sense of many of the
records, but even the casual visitor cannot
but be struck by the artistry that characterizes
many of the petrographs. One who
has Spanish enough to give zest to the quest
could easily spend a couple of days, camped
at this fascinating spot, spelling out the
quaint old notations, peopling again in fancy
this ancient camp-ground with the warriors
of long ago in helmet and cuirass, their
horses housed in leather; and ever with
them the Franciscan soldiers of the Cross
in gray gown and cord with dangling crucifix.
Then there is the enjoyment of the
place itself&mdash;the sunny solitude, and the
glorious, extended views, the long blue line
of the Zu&ntilde;i Mountains, the pale spires of
La Puerta de los Gigantes (the Giants&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
Gate). Then, if you like, is the climb to
the mesa&rsquo;s summit for yet wider views,
and a sight of the ruined old pueblo there,
whereof history has naught to tell&mdash;only
tradition, which says that it was once a
Zu&ntilde;ian town.</p>
<p>There is some doubt as to the earliest
inscription on the Rock. One questionable
writing, unsigned, appears to be 1580. Next
in point of antiquity is the undoubted record
of O&ntilde;ate, cut across an earlier Indian petrograph,
and reads <i>literatim</i>: &ldquo;Paso por aqi
el adelantado don jua de o&ntilde;ate del descubrimiento
de la mar del sur a 16 del abril
del 1606.&rdquo; (That is: Passed by here the
provincial chief Don Juan de O&ntilde;ate from
the discovery of the South Sea on 16th of
April, 1606.) The discovery he records as
of the South Sea (i.e., Pacific Ocean) was
really of the Gulf of California, for O&ntilde;ate
doubtless believed as most of the world did
in his day that California was an island.
Oddly enough, though, he made a mistake
in the date, which documentary evidence
proves to have been 1605 not 1606.</p>
<p>The inscription of De Vargas, the reconqueror,
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
following the Pueblo rebellion
of 1680, reads: &ldquo;Aqui estaba el Genl Dn.
Do de Vargas quien conquisto a nuestra
santa fe y la real corona todo el nuevo
Mexico a su costa a&ntilde;o de 1692.&rdquo; (Here
was the General Don Diego de Vargas who
conquered to our holy faith and the royal
crown all New Mexico, at his own expense,
year of 1692.)</p>
<p>Records of especial interest, too, are two
of 1629, telling of the passing by of Governor
Silva Nieto. One is in rhymed verse<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a>
and refers to Nieto as the &ldquo;bearer of the
Faith to Zu&ntilde;i;&rdquo; that is, he had acted as
escort of the first Christian missionaries to
pagan Zu&ntilde;i. A tragic sequel to that inscription
is a short one that is so abbreviated
that scholars have had a hard tussle with it.
The puzzle has been solved, however. You
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
will know this petroglyph by the signature
Lujan, a soldier, and the date 1632; and it
reads, Englished: &ldquo;They passed on 23
March 1632 to the avenging of Padre Letrado&rsquo;s
death.&rdquo; Zu&ntilde;i did not take kindly to its
missionaries and killed them periodically.
This Padre Letrado was one of the martyrs&mdash;shot
to death as he preached, holding
out his crucifix to his murderers.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>
<p>In delicate, almost feminine, characters is
a modest inscription that reads, translated:
&ldquo;I am from the hand of Felipe de Avellano,
16 September, soldier.&rdquo; There is something
touching, I think, about that personified
periphrase, and I am glad that, in spite of
the omission of the year, historians have
identified the writer. He was a common
soldier of the garrison at Zu&ntilde;i after the reconquest,
and met death there in 1700.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that this noble and
unique monument should be left exposed
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
as it is to vandals. Almost every white
visitor thinks it is his duty to scratch his
name up alongside the historic ones and
there is no guardian to forbid&mdash;only an
unregarded sign of the Department of the
Interior tacked on a nearby tree. A year
ago the Department, in response to private
representation, promised to put up a fence
of protection, and perhaps this has been
done; but a fence is a perfectly inadequate
measure. If the East possessed one such
autograph in stone (of Joliet, or La Salle,
or Cartier), as El Morro bears by the half
dozen, I wonder if the few hundred a year
necessary to support a local guardian would
not be forthcoming? When will our nation
take seriously the colonial history of the
Southwest as just as much its own as that
of the Atlantic side of the Continental
Divide?</p>
<p>At the shortest, it is a matter of two days
to achieve a visit to El Morro from the
railway. Gallup is the best stop-off. There
an automobile may be hired, and the night
spent at Ramah, where accommodations may
be had at the trader&rsquo;s unless you prefer to
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
camp at the Rock itself, which, if you like
such adventure and are prepared, is a joyous
thing to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">THE STORIED LAND OF THE NAVAJO</span></h2>
<p>The Navajos are the Bedouins of our
Southwest, and there are about 22,000 of
them&mdash;a fine, independent tribe of Indians
occupying a semi-desert, mountainous reservation
in northwestern New Mexico, northeastern
Arizona and a small corner of
Utah. Indeed they occupy somewhat more,
for they are confirmed rovers and are frequently
found setting up their <i>hogans</i>, shepherding
their sheep, and weaving their
blankets, well across their government-fixed
borders. One is sure to see some of them
in Gallup, where they come to trade&mdash;the
men generally in dark velveteen shirts worn
loose outside the trousers, their long, black,
uncut hair filleted about with red <i>bandas</i>
and caught up behind in a club or knot.
Both men and women are expert riders, sitting
their ponies as firmly as centaurs; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
both are extravagantly fond of silver jewelry,
of which they often wear small fortunes
in necklaces, belts, bracelets, rings and
buttons hammered by their own silversmiths
from coin of Mexico. If you see them
wearing blankets, as you will when the
weather requires it, these will be the gaudy
products of Yankee looms, which they buy
for less than the price they receive for their
own famous weave. So, thrifty traders
that they are, they let the white folk have
the latter and content themselves with the
cheaper machine-made article bought from
an American merchant.</p>
<p>It is part of the fun of a visit to the Hopi
towns that you must cross a section of the
Navajo Reservation and thus get a glimpse
of life in the latter; but there is a special
trip which I would like to recommend from
Gallup as a starting point, that brings one
more intimately into touch with the tribe.
That is to Chin Lee and the Ca&ntilde;on de
Chelly,<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> about 100 miles northwest of
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
Gallup. There is a choice of roads, so that
the going and returning may be by different
routes. The trip may be done by time
economists in an automobile in two or three
days, but a more enjoyable plan for easy-going
folk is to take eight or ten days to it
by horseback or wagon, camping by the
way. And do it preferably in September or
early October, for then the mid-year rains
are usually over, the air clear and sparkling,
and feed for horses sufficiently abundant.
The elements that enter into the landscape
are primarily those that go to the making
of the grandeur of the Grand Ca&ntilde;on region,
but scattered and distant, not concentrated.
There is a similar sculpturing of the land
into pinnacles and terraces, cones perfect
or truncated, battlemented castles and airy
spires, appearing, when afar, mistily in an
atmosphere of amethyst and mauve and indefinite
tones of yellow and pink. Now
the road threads open, sunny forests of pine
and oak, the latter in autumnal dress of
crimson and gold and surprising you with
acorns as sweet as chinquapins. Again, it
traverses broad, unwatered, semi-desert
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
plains dotted with fragrant sage-brush and
riotous sunflowers, the only animated things
in sight being prairie dogs and jackrabbits,
or an occasional band of Navajo ponies. As
the morning advances, cumulus clouds rise
in stately squadrons above the horizon and
move across the sky dropping drifting
shadows; at noon over a fire of sage stumps
you heat up your beans and brew your coffee
in the grateful shade of your wagon;
night finds you at some hospitable trader&rsquo;s
post, or enjoying your blankets at the sign
of <i>La belle &eacute;toile</i>. Only at long intervals
will you come upon sign of human life.
At Fort Defiance, 30 miles north of Gallup,
is a Government Reservation school for the
Navajos, and a mile from it an Episcopal
medical mission&mdash;a living monument to the
loving interest of Miss Eliza Thackara in
these Indians. Eight miles south of Fort
Defiance is the Franciscan Mission of St.
Michael&rsquo;s to the Navajo, where, if you are
interested, the hospitable Brothers can show
you what sort of a job it is to transform
an ungroomed savage into Christian semblance.
At Ganado, Arizona, 45 miles from
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
Gallup, is the trading post of Mr. J. L.
Hubbell, whose name for a generation has
in that part of the world been a synonym
for hospitality.<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is more life than you
see, for the native <i>hogan</i>, or one-roomed
dwelling of logs covered with earth, is so
inconspicuous that you may pass within a
few rods of one and never detect it. The
Navajos do not congregate in villages but
each family wants a lot&mdash;miles, indeed&mdash;of
elbow room.</p>
<p>Chin Lee, mentioned above, is not Chinese
as it sounds, but the Navajo name of a spacious
valley into which Ca&ntilde;on de Chelly
debouches. If you have a taste for mythology,
it will interest you to know that
here, according to tradition, Ests&aacute;n-atlehi
(the chief goddess of the Navajo pantheon
and wife of the Sun-god), traveling from
the east once camped with her attendant
divinities for a great ceremony and a footrace.
She was on her way to her home in
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
the great water of the west, where in a
floating house she still lives, and receives
her lord the Sun every evening when his
daily work is finished.<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> There is a trading
post at Chin Lee, and beyond the broad
flat in front of it is the entrance to Ca&ntilde;on
de Chelly. This is a narrow, tortuous rift
in the earth, some 20 miles long, whose
perpendicular sides of red sandstone rise
800 to 1000 feet. Opening into it are two
side gorges, Monument and Del Muerto
Ca&ntilde;ons. A shallow stream of sweet water&mdash;sometimes,
however, hidden beneath the
sands&mdash;creeps along the ca&ntilde;on floor, widens
in the plain into the Rio de Chelly, and
flowing northward joins the San Juan in
southern Utah. So in time does it contribute
its bit to the tawny flood that pours
through the Grand Ca&ntilde;on of the Colorado.<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a></p>
<p>The interests that hold the visitor in
Ca&ntilde;on de Chelly are several. There is, first,
the stupendous scenery. Men and animals
traversing this level floor seem pygmies at
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
the foot of the smooth, vertical walls, carved
and stained by the master-artist Time working
through who knows how many milleniums.
The windings of the gorge keep one
in perpetual expectancy of something going
to happen just around the corner, and
create an atmosphere of mystery that is
little short of thrilling. In places the ca&ntilde;on
widens out in sunlit coves and wild-grass
meadows, where clustered reeds<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> rustle and
wild flowers bloom. Quite as often, though,
the walls are so close together that the
sunshine never reaches the bottom and the
grim surroundings suggest some overwhelming
picture of Dor&eacute;&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Then there are the ancient dwellings in
the cliffs&mdash;little, crumbling cities of the
dead. Perched high up in shallow cavities
of the flat wall, some are inaccessible except
by ladders; others, may be reached by
scrambling up talus slopes. One famous
one, known as Mummy Cave, in Ca&ntilde;on
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
del Muerto, should by all means be visited;
but even more striking is one in the main
ca&ntilde;on called <i>La Casa Blanca</i> or the White
House. The upper story of this majestic
ruin, which strikingly resembles some
medieval castle, is colored white; and the
whole line of the immense edifice set high
above the earth and projected against the
dark background of a natural cavity in the
enormous cliff, makes a dramatic picture.
The effect is heightened when we learn
that in Navajo folk-lore it plays a part as
the abode of certain genii or minor divinities
who, the faithful believe, still haunt
the edifice.</p>
<p>In places the cliffs are prehistoric art
galleries, adorned with pictographs of
unheard-of birds and animals, human
hands outspread, geometrical designs,
and attenuated figures of men in various
attitudes.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is the interest of a present-day
Indian life, for the ca&ntilde;on is the free,
joyous home of numerous Navajo families,
that come and go as fancy dictates.
Their <i>hogans</i>, often with a hand-loom for
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
blanket weaving<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> swung from a nearby tree
are set inconspicuously here and there at
the base of the towering cliffs, wherever
there is a bit of land suitable for the raising
of corn, beans and melons. Peach orchards,
too, are here, from seed of Spanish introduction
centuries ago. Flocks of sheep and
goats are continually on the move up and
down the ca&ntilde;on, which is musical with their
bleatings and the wild melody of the shepherds&rsquo;
songs. It is a picturesque sight at
evening to see the homing bands crowding
into the primitive folds which sometimes
are a mere crevice in the rock walls with a
rude fence thrown across the opening.</p>
<p>During the wars which for many years
marked the intercourse of the Navajos
with the whites&mdash;both Spaniards and
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
Americans&mdash;the Ca&ntilde;on de Chelly was a
notable stronghold of the red men. It was
here that in 1864 Kit Carson and his
troopers at last succeeded in breaking the
backbone of the Indian resistance. Today
the Navajos are as peaceable as the Pueblos.</p>
<p>According to Navajo legends, the boundaries
of their land were marked out for
them by the gods who brought them up
through the great reed from the lower
world.<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> These landmarks were in the form
of mountains especially created for the
purpose of earth brought from the lower
world, and were seven in number. Of these
the Sacred Mountain of the East is believed
to be Pelado Peak, 20 miles northeast of
Jemes pueblo and it was made fast to the
earth by a bolt of lightning; the Sacred
Mountain of the South is known to be
Mount San Mat&eacute;o, 20 miles or so northwest
of Laguna pueblo, held in place by a great
stone knife thrust through it from summit
to base; the Sacred Mountain of the West,
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
is the San Francisco Mountain, 12 miles
north of Flagstaff, Arizona, fastened down
by a sunbeam; and the Sacred Mountain of
the North is some one of the San Juan
range, which a rainbow held in place. The
other three are peaks of the mid-region,
only one of which, Hosta Butte in Bernalillo
County, New Mexico, has been identified.<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a>
Two of these mountains are plainly
visible from the Santa Fe Railway trains
and by motorists following the National
Old Trails transcontinental highway&mdash;namely,
the San Francisco Mountain (12,611
feet) and Mount San Mat&eacute;o (11,389 feet).
Both are extinct volcanoes. The vicinity
of Mount San Mat&eacute;o (which is also known
as Mount Taylor)<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a> is the scene of a thrilling
tradition. There it was that the Navajo
Gods of War (children of the Sun and of
the Waterfall), mounted upon a rainbow,
met and slew with lightning bolts the boy-eating
giant, Ye-itso. The latter was a
monster so huge that the spread of his two
feet was a day&rsquo;s journey for a man, his footfalls
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
were as thunder, and when he drank
his draught exhausted a lake. His head,
cut off by the War-gods and tossed away,
was changed into El Cabezon, a truncated
cone of a mountain visible 40 miles northeast
from San Mat&eacute;o; and his blood flowing
in a deluge to the south and west
is what we white folk in our ignorance
call a hardened lava-flow, as we watch
it from the car window for miles westward
from McCarty&rsquo;s. Look at it again
with the eyes of faith, and is not its
semblance that of coagulated, blackened
blood?</p>
<p>So you see in this glorious Southwest
we may still follow in the very footsteps of
the gods, and regard the world as it seems
through the eyes of a primitive and poetic
race&mdash;see in the lightning the weapon of the
red gods, in the rainbows their bridges to
traverse chasms withal, in the sunbeams
their swift cars of passage. There is something
rather exhilarating, I think, to know
that in our materialistic America there is a
region where the Ancient Ones still haunt
as in the youth of the world. To be sure
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
the white man&rsquo;s schools are operating to
break up this primitive faith; but the ingrained
genius of a race is not made over
in a generation. One may stumble still
upon Navajo religious ceremonies, held in
the open, with their picturesque rites and
maskings and wild music. They differ
markedly from the ceremonies of the Pueblos,
and are, as a rule, undertaken under
the charge of medicine men primarily for
the cure of the sick. There are no fixed
dates for any of these ceremonies, and casual
travelers do not often see them, as they are
most likely to be held during the cold
weather, when few visitors care to penetrate
into the country. An exceedingly interesting
adjunct of many of the Navajo rites is
the dry sand painting, of a symbolic character
and often of striking beauty, made in
color upon a prepared flooring of sand. The
design is &ldquo;drawn&rdquo; on this by dribbling upon
it the dry ground pigments&mdash;white, red,
yellow, black and gray&mdash;from between the
artist&rsquo;s thumb and fore-finger. The picture
must be done in one day, several men sometimes
working upon it at once. When completed
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
the sick man is placed upon it and
treated; and after that, the picture is
obliterated.<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">THE HOMES OF THE HOPIS, LITTLE PEOPLE OF PEACE</span></h2>
<p>Now that the automobile has become a
common mode of travel even in the desert,
you may reach the pueblos of the Hopi
Indians quite comfortably from Gallup.<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a>
The distance is about 130 miles to the first
of the villages. The road is via St. Michael&rsquo;s
(where the Franciscan Brothers maintain a
Mission for the Navajos); Ganado, where
Mr. J. L. Hubbell&rsquo;s trading post stands;
and Keam&rsquo;s Ca&ntilde;on, where Mr. Lorenzo
Hubbell, hospitable son of a hospitable
father, has another trading post. As far
as Ganado (70 miles) the way is identical
with the first part of one road to the Ca&ntilde;on
de Chelly. From Ganado westward there
are 60 miles of pure wilderness, semi-desert,
treeless, but in summer and autumn splendid
in places with sheets of wild flowers in
purple and yellow. On every hand&mdash;sometimes
near, sometimes afar&mdash;are the characteristic
mesa formations of the Southwest
carved by the elements into curious shapes
to which the fancy readily suggests names.
One that you will pass is a strikingly good
model of a battleship&rsquo;s dismantled hull, and
goes by the name of Steamboat Rock&mdash;a
pleasant conceit for this desert, which, the
geologists tell us, was once a sea bottom.
Nowhere is sign of humanity, save perhaps,
some wandering Navajos or a chance traveler
like yourself.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>At last there comes a change over the
country ahead of you&mdash;a transfiguration to
broad sweeps of pink and pallid yellow, with
here and there a streak of white or of green,
and on the far horizon a wall of purple.
The Painted Desert is before you, and upon
the very tip of a long promontory streaked
horizontally with brown and red and yellow,
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
and laid upon the desert like a gigantic arm
thrust out, you see the castellated sky-line
formed by the pueblos of the First Hopi
Mesa. The geography of the Hopi country
is like this: Three long, narrow mesas extending
fingerlike into the Painted Desert,
the tips about 10 miles each from the next.
On the First Mesa (which is the easternmost)
are three villages in an almost continuous
row&mdash;Hano (called also Tewa),
which you plump breathlessly into at the
top of the one steep trail which is your
means of access to all; then Sich&uacute;movi, and
lastly, at the mesa&rsquo;s extremity with all the
desert in front, is Walpi, a most picturesque
pile rising in terraces to 4 stories and suggesting
some mediaeval fortress. The Second
Mesa is forked at its tip, with Mish&oacute;ngnovi
and Shipa&uacute;lovi set superbly along one
tine, and Shim&oacute;povi<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a> on the other. On the
Third Mesa stands old Oraibi, largest and
until recently most populous of all. Some
years ago, however, it suffered a secession
of fully half its population, who are now
established a few miles away on the same
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
mesa forming the independent pueblos of
H&oacute;tavila and B&aacute;cavi.<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a></p>
<p>The situation of these little towns is magnificent
beyond words, overlooking the
Painted Desert, ever changing, ever wonderful,
ever challenging the spiritual in you,
and stretching to where the San Francisco
Peaks, the Mogollones and the White Mountains
notch the dim horizon line. The elevation
(6000 feet above the sea) and the
purity and dryness of the air, combine to
make the climate particularly healthful and
enjoyable. Winter brings frosts and some
snow, alternating with brilliant sunshine.
Summer, the season that interests the average
visitor, is as a rule delightful&mdash;the
afternoon thunder showers of July and
August being only a refreshment and a
source of added picturesqueness in the form
of superb cloud effects, spectacular lightning,
and splendid rainbows. Mid-day is
warm enough for old men to loiter in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
sun in a costume that is pared down to a
breech clout and little children joyously
wear nothing at all; yet both need covering
in the shade. As for the summer nights,
they are always deliciously cool and for
outdoor sleeping are ideal. The flat-roofed,
eaveless houses are usually of flat stones laid
in mud mortar, and though terraced, do not
usually exceed two or three stories in height.
The arrangement is in streets and plazas,
the <i>kivas</i> or ceremonial chambers (corresponding
to the <i>estufas</i> of the Rio Grande
pueblos) being underground and reached
by a descending ladder, whose upper part&mdash;two
rungless poles&mdash;stick picturesquely up
in the air. There is a growing tendency to
build the new houses at the bases of the
cliffs, particularly at the First and Third
Mesas&mdash;a reversal to first principles; for
when Don Pedro de Tovar, a lieutenant of
Coronado, with Padre Juan de Padilla (of
whom we heard at Isleta) and a few soldiers,
visited in 1540 this province of Tusayan,
as they called the country, they reported
the Hopis dwelling at the foot of
the mesas. It was only later, probably after
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
the Pueblo Rebellion of 1680, that the towns
were rebuilt upon the mesa summits where
we now find them. The sites of two former
Walpis may still be traced below the First
Mesa together with the ruins of an ancient
Franciscan Mission, some of whose timbers,
they say, form part of the existing pagan
<i>kivas</i>. The Hopi never took kindly to missionary
effort by the whites. Every <i>padre</i>
among them was murdered at the time of
the Rebellion, and they would never tolerate
another. Even kind Padre Garc&eacute;s (of
whom we shall hear in a subsequent chapter)
the Oraibians kept sitting outdoors in
a street corner for two days, and then
evicted him from their town. In 1700, one
pueblo whose inhabitants showed a hospitable
feeling to the preaching of a persistent
friar, was attacked by neighboring Hopis,
set on fire and such of the inhabitants as
were not killed, were carried to other towns.
Of that pueblo&mdash;its name was Aw&aacute;tobi&mdash;you
may see some ruined remnants yet about
9 miles southeast of Walpi.<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>The attraction that draws most visitors
to the country of the Hopi Indians is the
famous Snake Dance held annually in
August. The date is a movable one and not
known positively until 9 days in advance,
when the information may be had of the
Santa Fe railway officials, who make it a
point to be posted. This remarkable ceremony,
in which live snakes, a large proportion
of them venomous rattlers, are
handled by the dance participants as nonchalantly
as if they were kittens, is in fact
a prayer for rain, in which the snakes (never
harmed or their fangs extracted as is sometimes
ignorantly supposed), are intermediaries
between the people and the gods of
water. It is moreover the dramatization
of a Hopi myth concerning the origin of
the two clans&mdash;Antelope and Snake&mdash;who
perform the ceremony. The myth has to
do with the adventures of a young man
who, impelled by curiosity to know where
the river waters went, made a trip on a hollow
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
log down the Colorado to its mouth.
There he had many dealings with the Snake
people, in whose ways he was instructed by
the friendly Spider Woman. Finally he
married the Snake chief&rsquo;s daughter, and
brought her to his own country. The first
children of this union were snakes, which
the Hopis drove away, but the next were
human, and these, the ancestors of the present
Snake Clan, came to Walpi to live. The
entire ceremony continues throughout 9
days, and is conducted secretly in the underground
<i>kiva</i> until near sunset of the last
day. Then the priests dramatically emerge
into the upper air, and the dance with the
snakes occurs. It is all over in about half
an hour, but that half hour is what brings
the crowd&mdash;about the most thrilling and
wide-awake performance that is offered
anywhere in America. Though the Snake
Dance takes place annually, all the villages
do not hold it the same year. The most
frequented presentations are those at Walpi,
held in the odd years, as 1917, 1919, etc.,
and at Oraibi, the latter in the even years,
as 1918, 1920, etc.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The Snake Dance attracts largely through
the horror awakened in most of us by reptiles,
though it possesses many elements of
majestic beauty, too. There are numerous
other Hopi ceremonies whose dominant
feature to the white onlooker is simple
beauty; for instance, the picturesque Flute
ceremony held at springs below the mesas,
and then along the ascending trails to the
mesa-top accompanied by songs, the music
of native flutes and the scattering of flowers.
This ceremony, which is also the
dramatization of a legend<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> as well as an invocation
for rain, alternates with the Snake
Dance, being held at about but not at the
identical time with it, and always at other
pueblos than those holding the Snake Dance.
This permits attenders at one to witness
the other also. Then at all the pueblos there
are the autumnal Basket Dances of the
women, and in spring and summer the many
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
beautiful Katchina Dances. Katchinas are
the deified spirits of the Hopis&rsquo; ancestors,
and are intercessors with the greater gods
for divine favors for the Hopis. They are
supposed to reside amid the San Francisco
Peaks, where the home of the Sun god is, the
great dispenser of blessings. Their annual
visits (Indians of the pueblo impersonating
the gods) are the occasions of much merry-making,
of songs and processions, and
dances in mask and gay costumes. Each
god has his distinctive mask and dress, and
the queer little wooden &ldquo;dolls&rdquo; (as the
traders call them, though &ldquo;Katchina&rdquo; is the
better word), which the visitors find in
Hopi houses are careful representations of
these, made for the children of the household
to familiarize themselves with the
characteristic aspect of each divinity. &ldquo;These
dances,&rdquo; to quote Mr. Walter Hough, whose
excellent little work, &ldquo;The Hopi,&rdquo; should be
read by every intending visitor, &ldquo;show the
cheerful Hopi at his best&mdash;a true spontaneous
child of nature. They are the most
characteristic ceremonies of the pueblos,
most musical, spectacular and pleasing.
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
They are really more worthy of the attention
of white people than the forbidding
Snake Dance, which overshadows them by
the elements of horror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visitors who allow themselves to be hurried
up to the Hopi towns the day before
the Snake Dance and then packed off home
the next morning, as most of them do, may
think they have had a good time, but it
is largely the bliss of ignorance. They do
not know what they have missed by not
spending a week or two. To be sure accommodations
are limited and primitive,
but one must expect to rough it more or
less in Indian country. Still the Hopis are
not savages and one can be made comfortable.
It is generally possible to rent one of
the small houses at the foot of the mesa,
if one does not bring one&rsquo;s own camp outfit,
and there are traders at most of the villages
where supplies of necessaries may be
obtained. Climb the trail to the sunny,
breeze-swept mesa top; get acquainted with
the merry, well-behaved little children&mdash;easy
enough, particularly if you have a little stock
of candy; watch the women making <i>piki</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
(the thin wafer-like corn-bread of many
colors that is the Hopi staff of life), or
molding or burning pottery; see the men
marching off, huge hoes on shoulder, to cultivate
their corn and beans, sometimes miles
away, in damp spots of the desert, or coming
inward-bound driving burros laden with
firewood or products of the field. All this,
in an architectural setting that is as picturesque
as Syria, replete with entrancing &ldquo;bits&rdquo;
that are a harvest to the artist or the kodaker.
After a day or two you will have
had your measure pretty well taken by the
population, and granting your manners
have been decent, you will be making friends,
and every day will show you something
new in the life of this most interesting race.
Of course there is a difference in the different
towns&mdash;the customs of some have
been more modified than others by contact
with the whites and the influence of the
Government educational system. The Walpians
and their neighbors are perhaps the
most Americanized; the people of H&oacute;tavila
and Shim&oacute;povi, the least so.</p>
<p>The Hopis possess arts of great interest.
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
Pottery of beautiful form and design is
made at Hano<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a> of the First Mesa. This
tiny village has the honor of being the home
of the most famous of Indian potters, Namp&eacute;yo,
whose work is so exquisite that it
looks distinctive in any company. Her
daughter Kwatsoa seems nearly as gifted.
Then there is basketry. Curiously enough
the East Mesa makes no baskets whatever,
and the baskets of the Middle Mesa are
quite of another sort from those of the
Third Mesa, and both so different from all
other Indian baskets whatsoever, as to be
recognized at a glance. The Third Mesa
baskets are woven wicker work usually in
the form of a tray or plaque, the design
symbolizing birds, clouds, butterflies, etc.,
in glaring aniline dyes. Those of the Second
Mesa are in heavy coils sewed together
with a thread of the yucca wrapping, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
in various shapes from flat to globular, the
latter sometimes provided with handles.
Weaving is an ancient Hopi art that is
now unfortunately decadent. In pre-Spanish
days and for some time afterwards, the
Hopi cultivated a native cotton,<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a> and cotton
is still woven by them into ceremonial
kilts and cord. Formerly they were famous
weavers of rabbit-skin blankets. The visitor
may still run across an occasional one in
the pueblos, but the blanket of wool has long
since displaced them. The Hopis make of
weaving a man&rsquo;s business, which is usually
carried on in the <i>kivas</i> when these are not
being used for religious purposes. They
specialize in women&rsquo;s <i>mantas</i>, or one-piece
dresses, of a dark color with little or no ornamentation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">THE PETRIFIED FOREST OF ARIZONA</span></h2>
<p>Everybody enjoys his stop off at the Petrified
Forest. For one thing, this sight is as
easy of achievement as falling off a log, and
that counts heavily with your average
American tourist. Even if your train drops
you at Adamana<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a> in the middle of the night,
as some trains do, there will be somebody
there to carry your bag and pilot you the
couple of hundred yards to the lone hotel
which, with the railroad station and the
water tank, is practically all there is of
Adamana. Then you are put comfortably
to bed in a room that awaits you. In the
morning you are given a leisurely breakfast
at your own hour, and packed in an
automobile to see one part of the Forest;
brought home to luncheon; and in the afternoon
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
motored off to another part. If you
are an invalid or just naturally lazy, you
need not even leave your seat in the conveyance.
After that it is your choice to
proceed on your travels, or stay over another
day and visit more distant parts of the
Forest. In seeing the Forest, you incidentally
have several miles of reasonably easy driving
over the vast northern Arizona plateau
with its wide views to the edge of a world
hemmed in with many a dreamy mountain
range and long, colorful, flat-topped mesas
breaking away in terraces and steps to the
plains. You will quite possibly see coyotes
and jackrabbits and prairie dogs, cattle grazing
the wild grasses, a Navajo Indian or
two, cowboys on their loping ponies, perhaps
a round-up with its trailing chuckwagon.
You will steep yourself in the
delicious Arizona sunshine, and be humbled
before the majesty of the glorious Arizona
sky, blue as sapphire and piled high at
times with colossal masses of cumulus clouds
that forevermore will mean Arizona to you.</p>
<p>The Forest is unfortunately mis-named,
for it is not a forest. There is not a single
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
standing trunk, such as you may see occasionally
in Utah or the Yellowstone. In
the midst of a treeless plain the broken logs
litter the ground in sections rarely over 25
feet long, oftenest in short chunks as if
sawn apart, and in chips and splinters innumerable.
Trunk diameters of 2 or 3 feet
are common, and as high as 6 feet has been
reported. It seems likely that the trees did
not grow where they now lie but have been
washed hither in some prehistoric swirl of
waters, (as logs are carried down stream
in our latter-day puny freshets,) becoming
stranded in certain depressions of the land
where we now find them, often having had
their woody tissue gradually replaced by
silica and agatized. Whence they came nobody
knows, nor when. The guess of the
unlettered guide who shows you about, may
be as near right as the trained geologist&rsquo;s,
who locates the time of their fall as the
Triassic Age, and their old home as perhaps
beside some inland sea; but whether that
was one million years ago or twenty, who
can say, further than that they surely antedate
the appearance of man upon this
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
planet. The trees are evidently of different
sorts, but mostly conifers apparently related
to our present day araucarias, of
which the Norfolk Island pine is a familiar
example. Mr. F. H. Knowlton, botanist of
the Smithsonian Institution, identifies then
as <i>Araucarioxylon Arizonicum</i>, an extinct
tree once existing also in the east-central
United States.<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a> Limbs and branches in anything
approaching entirety are not found&mdash;only
the trunks and infinite fragments are
here. The coloration due to the presence of
iron oxides in the soil at the time of silicification
is often exquisite, in shades of pink,
yellow, blue, brown, crimson&mdash;a never failing
source of delight to visitors. Dr. L.
F. Ward, of the United States Geological
Survey, has said that &ldquo;there is no other
petrified forest in which the wood assumes
so many varied and interesting forms and
colors.... The state of mineralization in
which much of this wood exists almost
places it among the gems or precious stones.
Not only are chalcedony, opals and agates
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
found among them, but many approach the
condition of jasper and onyx.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a></p>
<p>The parts of the Forest that tourists
usually visit are the so-called First Forest,
about 6 miles south of Adamana (which
contains the huge trunk that spans a picturesque
chasm 45 feet wide, and is known as
the Natural Bridge<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a>); the Second Forest,
2&frac12; miles further south; and the North
Forest. The last is 9 miles due north from
Adamana, at the edge of such a chaotic,
burned-out bit of volcanic waste, as is in
itself worth seeing, breaking away gradually
into the Painted Desert. If for any reason,
your time is too limited to admit of your
visiting more than one section of the Forest,
by all means, let that section be this North
Forest. The trees are less numerous and
the fragments are less strikingly colored
than in the parts to the south, but that background
of color and mystery given by the
desert, lends a fascination and gives to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
picture a composition that is unique and unforgettable.</p>
<p>There is, moreover, the so-called Third
or Rainbow Forest,<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a> 13 miles southwest of
Adamana. This region contains the most
numerous and the largest trunks, some of
them (partially underground) measuring
upwards of 200 feet in length. The
especially rich coloring of the wood here
has given rise to the local name &ldquo;Rainbow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In several parts of the Petrified Forest (a
large portion of which is now, by the way,
a National Monument), are the ruins of
many small prehistoric Indian villages. The
relics found indicate that four different
stocks of Indians have lived among these
shattered trees, one clearly Hopi, another
probably Zu&ntilde;ian, the others undetermined
(one apparently of cannibalistic habits).
Dr. Walter Hough has written very entertainingly
of this human interest of the Petrified
Forest in Harpers&rsquo; Magazine for November,
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
1902. The houses of the Rainbow
Forest were unique in aboriginal architecture
in that they were constructed of petrified
logs. To quote Dr. Hough: &ldquo;It is probable
that prehistoric builders never chose
more beautiful stones for the construction
of their habitations than the trunks of the
trees which flourished ages before man appeared
on the earth. This wood agate also
furnished material for stone hammers,
arrowheads and knives, which are often
found in ruins hundreds of miles from the
Forest.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a></p>

<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">FLAGSTAFF AS A BASE</span></h2>
<p>A score of years ago Flagstaff<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a> was
chiefly known to the traveler as the gateway
to the Grand Ca&ntilde;on of the Colorado, 70
miles to the northwest. One may still reach
that marvelous chasm by automobile from
Flagstaff, arriving at Grand View after 5
or 6 hours&rsquo; driving, now through a park-like
forest of yellow pine, now across an
open plateau region with alluring views of
far-off mountain ranges and of the Painted
Desert. The completion of the railroad spur
from Williams to the Grand Ca&ntilde;on, however,
put a quietus upon the operation of the
horse stages from Flagstaff; and since the
passing of the Grand Ca&ntilde;on business the
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
town has cut small figure in tourist itineraries,
its energies since being concentrated
on the less precarious profits from lumber,
cattle and wool. Nevertheless, its situation
in a clearing of the beautiful Coconino
National Forest, 7000 feet above the sea
makes it a convenient base for visiting certain
attractions of a remarkable nature
thereabout, as lava beds, ice caves, extinct
volcanoes, prehistoric cliff<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a> and cinder-cone
dwellings, the Painted Desert, and
the famous San Francisco Peaks, fabled
home of the Hopi Katchinas and the scene
of many an Indian legend. The town has
several hotels of a modest sort, and is on
the line of the National Old Trails transcontinental
motor highway; and if you
have your own car or the wherewithal to
rent one in Flagstaff, you can be very happy
in this neighborhood for a week or two.
The town itself, with a population of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
couple of thousand, has a certain picturesqueness
of an up-to-date frontier fashion, in
which automobiles and soda-pop largely
take the place of ponies, pistols and &ldquo;forty-rod,&rdquo;
for at this writing the hand of &ldquo;bone
dry&rdquo; Prohibition rests paternally upon
Arizona. Especially interesting are Saturday
nights, when the streets are likely to
be thronged with lumberjacks, cowpunchers
and ranchers&mdash;American and Mexican&mdash;come
to town to swap news and trade, to
see the &ldquo;shows,&rdquo; play pool and listen to the
&ldquo;rag&rdquo; of blatant gramophones. A Navajo
or two, standing in the glare of the electric
lights, may add a touch of aboriginal color
to the scene&mdash;teamsters for some desert
trading post.</p>
<p>Dominating Flagstaff, as Mont Blanc
dominates Chamonix, is the isolated mountain
mass, the highest in Arizona, called the
San Francisco Peaks, snow-crowned seven
or eight months in the year and familiar to
every traveler by the Santa Fe&rsquo;s transcontinental
trains. Their clustered half-dozen
summits in the form of graceful cones attain
a maximum elevation of 12,611 feet
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
above the sea (5600 feet above Flagstaff)
and have been a famous landmark from the
time of the Spanish conquistadores, who
named them, to the present day. The Navajos,
as has been told in a previous chapter,
assign to the great mountain a divine construction
from earth brought up in the
Emergence from the underworld, the gods
who built it pinning it down poetically with
a sunbeam. Matter-of-fact geologists, however,
consider the mass as merely an extinct
volcano with its top blown off, and find its
flanks covered with the congealed lava
streams of successive eruptions. The disintegrated
surfaces of lava make a fertile
bed for the abundant forests, gardens of wild
flowers, and natural fields of indigenous
grasses that clothe the base and sides up to
within a few hundred feet of the craggy top.
If you have a taste for mountain climbing
and fine outlooks, by all means give a
day or two to the San Francisco Mountain.
It is of easiest ascent, and the views, full of
delight from the moment you leave Flagstaff,
attain at the summit a climax that is
nothing short of dramatic. The whole of
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
the northern and central Arizona plateau is
spread below and about you in such glory of
color (if the atmospheric conditions be
right) as you have never dreamt of. You
can pick out the farther wall of the Grand
Ca&ntilde;on and the Buckskin Mountains beyond;
the companion volcanic cones of Kendrick,
Bill Williams,<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a> and Sitgreaves to the westward;
the Mogollon Mesa stretching south
towards Phoenix; the Verde Valley; the
Red Rock Country and Oak Creek Ca&ntilde;on;
Sunset Peak;<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a> and most striking of all, the
glory of the Painted Desert stretching
illimitably to the northeast, with the Little
Colorado River winding across it to join the
Big Colorado 60 miles due north of you.
The opportunity to enjoy that unobscured
outlook upon the desert from a point over a
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
mile above it, is alone a sufficient reward
for the trip. It is like looking on another
world, so unearthly are the tones in which
that marvelous waste is dyed&mdash;indefinite
shades of yellow, pink, crimson, brown,
cream, green; so striking the sculpturing of
its mesas and promontories. Then, too, if
you have a spark of romance in your make-up,
will it not be an event to tread the very
pathways of the gods with whom the Indian
fancy has peopled the glades and gorges of
this hoary old volcano, as the Greeks peopled
Ida&mdash;to know that somewhere in these
sunny, piny slopes is the fabled house of the
Sun God, who, when he would travel, summons
a rainbow, as you or I would ring for
a taxicab, and to whom, it is said, the Hopis
still send prayer plumes by a messenger who
trots the 70 miles from the pueblos hither
between sunrise and sunset of a summer
day?</p>
<p>Would it not give you a thrill to feel
when passing through the aspen groves that
dot the upper heights, that in such a rustling
wood here upon this very mountain, when
the world was young, the Hero-Children of
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
the Spider Woman slew the wicked Giant
Elk who ravaged the land of the Hopi&mdash;those
Hero-Children of whom one was
Youth, begotten of the Light, and the other
Echo, begotten of the Raindrop?<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a></p>
<p>From Flagstaff to the tip of Humphrey&rsquo;s
Peak, the highest of all, is 10 miles in a bee-line,
or about 15 as pedestrians and horses
go. Of this distance about 5 miles are by
a good road practicable for automobiles, now
winding through open forest, now skirting
some ranch&mdash;a pleasant, old-fashioned highway
bordered with worm fences and thickets
of wild rose and goldenrod. From a certain
point on the road to the Peaks, which
are always in view, an easy trail leads
through a charming forest to which the absence
of underbrush gives a park-like character,
open and sunny and carpeted in places
with wild flowers. The prevailing trees for
a couple of thousand feet of the ascent are
yellow pines, rising at their best to a height
of over 100 feet and probably of an age of
300 to 500 years. Above this yellow pine
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
belt the trail steepens and zigzags sharply
bringing you out at last amid broken stone
and volcanic scoriae where no trees are, only
shy sub-alpine plants clinging by their toes
to the crevices of the rocks. Here a hog-back
joins Humphrey&rsquo;s Peak (12,611 feet)
and Agassiz (12,330 feet), and you have
the choice of mounting to either or both.
Under the eastern slopes of these peaks a
glacier 2 miles long once headed, whose bed
is now a large valley within the mountain&rsquo;s
folds dropping downward to the northeast.
To the geological, this valley with its moraine
and glaciated rocks is a source of
especial interest, since it constitutes one of
the southernmost instances of ice action
within the United States.<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a></p>
<p>A good walker used to high altitudes can
do the round trip from Flagstaff to the summit
and back in a day of 12 hours, but he
should be sure to carry water. For the
average tourist, however, horseback is
recommended with a guide (procurable at
Flagstaff). Added interest will be secured
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
by arranging to camp over night upon the
mountain, for in this way the superb light
effects of early morning and evening may be
enjoyed at leisure. Owing to snow on the
peaks most of the year, the ascent must
usually be made between mid-June and mid-October.
June is probably the best month,
if snow is absent, as the atmosphere is then
apt to be at its clearest; after that, September
or early October is the choice. July and
August are months of frequent, almost
daily, thunderstorms, which, of course, are
disturbing factors in more ways than one.
Flagstaff, by the way, is credited by the
United States&rsquo; Geological Survey with a
greater rainfall than any other station in
Arizona, and this is attributed to its nearness
to the San Francisco Mountain.</p>
<p>Should you desire a closer acquaintance
with that harlequin of wastes, the Painted
Desert, there are from Flagstaff two trips
you can take across an end of it with
reasonable success in a motor car. One is to
the Hopi village of Oraibi by way of Tolcheco,
and the other to Tuba. The distance
in each case is about 70 miles. To Tuba
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
there is a semi-weekly automobile stage
(with shovel and water bags strapped to it),
making the round trip usually inside of one
day. It is an interesting excursion, taking
you close to Sunset Peak, with its remarkable
rosy crest, and over the Little Colorado
River by a bridge that makes the traveler
independent of the sudden rises of that erratic
stream. You will pass here and there
mounds that are the crumbled remains of
prehistoric pueblos, and again stone chips
and bits of trunks of petrified trees, the
scattered fragments of vanished forests of
which the Petrified Forest of Adamana is
our most perfect remnant. Sometimes we
pass beneath ruddy cliffs eroded and
weathered into such grotesqueness of face
and figure as would make Alice out of
Wonderland feel at home, squat toads and
humped camels and ogres with thick grinning
lips. Farther away, mesas jutting into
the desert present the semblance of cities
with towers and ramparts in ghostly tones
of pink and yellow and cream.<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a> Occasionally
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
an auto-truck, hauling goods to or from
some desert trade-post, passes you, and
sometimes a wagon train of wool, horse-drawn,
in charge of Navajo teamsters. Approaching
Tuba, you cross the Moenkopi
Wash, and are refreshed with the greenery
of the farms of the Hopis, who from time
immemorial have occupied this haunt of
moisture. If you have time to visit the little
pueblo of Moenkopi, 2 miles from Tuba and
perched on the mesa edge overlooking the
farms, it will interest you. It is the westernmost
of all the Hopi villages, its population
of a couple of hundred enjoying life in
Indian fashion with abounding dances and
thanksgiving. At Tuba itself, there is not
much for the casual visitor, except a couple
of Indian trading establishments and a
Government Boarding School with its concomitant
buildings connected with the
Agency of the Western Navajo Reservation.
The region roundabout, however, includes
enough points of local interest to occupy a
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
two or three weeks&rsquo; vacation very pleasantly.
Accommodations are obtainable at a trader&rsquo;s
or one of the Government houses, and saddle
horses may be hired from the Indians. Some
65 miles to the north are certain remarkably
fine pueblo- or Cliff dwelling-ruins, known
as Betata Kin and Keet Seel, in Marsh
Pass.<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a></p>
<p>Twenty or thirty miles south of Flagstaff
is a region of unique interest, known as the
Oak Creek Valley, whither Flagstaffians
motor in season to fish for trout and enjoy
a bit of Arcady. There are a public resort
or two and a number of ranches in the valley,
tributary to which is some of the wildest
scenery in the Southwest. In adjacent
ca&ntilde;ons, whose sides often rise an almost
sheer 800 to 1000 feet, are the ruined habitations
of a prehistoric people (probably ancestors
of certain existing Hopi clans)&mdash;cliff
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
houses, cavate dwellings and fortified
eminences, the last advantageously adopted
by the Apaches in the wars of half a century
ago. The dominant color of the rock
is bright red, frequently in horizontal bands,
and has gained the region the popular appellation
of &ldquo;The Red Rock Country.&rdquo; The
ca&ntilde;on walls and outstanding rock masses
have been worn by the elements into columns,
minarets, steeples, temples and other
architectural semblances such as are shown
surpassingly in the Grand Ca&ntilde;on. Indian
pictographs abound&mdash;some prehistoric, some
evidently of modern Apache doing. Dr. J.
W. Fewkes, the scientific discoverer of the
region a quarter of a century ago, thought
himself justified in comparing it to the Garden
of the Gods, than which it is much
more extended.<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a></p>

<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE GRAND CA&Ntilde;ON OF THE COLORADO RIVER IN ARIZONA</span></h2>
<p>From Williams, on the Santa Fe&rsquo;s transcontinental
line, a branch runs due north
across 65 miles of the great Colorado
Plateau and lands the traveler at the very rim
of the Grand Ca&ntilde;on&mdash;one of the most enjoyable,
most novel, most awakening sights
among the Southwest&rsquo;s marvels. Even if
your arrival be at darkest midnight, you will
<i>feel</i> the nearness of that awful void in the
unseen&mdash;a strange and humbling experience.
For accommodations you have the choice of
American plan and what passes in the wilderness
for luxury at the big El Tov&aacute;r Hotel,<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a>
or of lodging yourself more economically
but comfortably enough in cabin or tent at
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
the nearby Bright Angel Camp with meals
<i>&aacute; la carte</i> at the Harvey Caf&eacute;. Then you
will want to know what to see.</p>
<p>The Grand Ca&ntilde;on is among those stupendous
natural wonders that the traveler needs
time to adjust himself to; and I am inclined
to believe that his first act in wisdom is to
sit down at the rim with a comprehensive
map before him and spend a leisurely hour
studying geography. Fortunately a very
good practical map is included in the Santa
Fe&rsquo;s folder that describes the Ca&ntilde;on, and
this may be had of any agent for the asking.
The names, taken from all sorts of mythologies
and philosophies&mdash;Hindu, Chinese,
Norse, British, Greek, Egyptian, with a
dash of Aztec and latter day American&mdash;and
given to the various prominent shapes
simulating temples, pagodas, castles, towers,
colonnades and what not, are rather bewildering
and indeed seem out of place in
mid-Arizona. In better taste, I think, are
the more simply named spots that commemorate
adjacent native tribes as Hopi, Walapai,
Zu&ntilde;i; old white dwellers by the rim like
Bass, Rowe and Hance; and explorers associated
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
with the Ca&ntilde;on, such as Powell,
Escalante and C&aacute;rdenas. C&aacute;rdenas, it may
not be amiss to state, was the officer dispatched
by Coronado from Zu&ntilde;i to learn
the truth about the great gorge and river,
the report of which Tovar had brought him
from the Hopis. It was C&aacute;rdenas and his
little company of a dozen soldiers, who, one
autumn day of 1540, were the first white
men to look into the mighty chasm. At the
bottom they could detect the great river
flowing, seemingly a mere thread of a rivulet;
but their attempts to reach it were fruitless,
so precipitous they found the Ca&ntilde;on
walls.<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a> The stream that first received the
name of Colorado, is the one we now call
Little Colorado. O&ntilde;ate dubbed it so&mdash;Spanish
for red&mdash;because of the color of its
turbid waters. The greater river in C&aacute;rdenas&rsquo;s
day was known as <i>el Rio del Tiz&oacute;n</i>,
the river of the Fire-brand&mdash;a name given it
by explorers of its lower waters because of
certain Indians on its bank whom the
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
Spaniards saw warming themselves with
brands taken from the fire. The Colorado
River as we now know it, and including its
tributaries the Grand and the Green, drains
a region only secondary to the basin of the
Mississippi. Its length from the headwaters
of the Green in Wyoming to the outlet
into the Gulf of California is about 2000
miles. The Grand Ca&ntilde;on (including 65
miles above the junction with the Little
Colorado and known as Marble Ca&ntilde;on)
is 283 miles in length, the walls varying from
3000 to nearly 6000 feet high and rising
from the river in a series of huge steps or
terraces, so that the width, which at the river
is from about 100 to 600 feet, increases to
several miles at the rim. The deepest part
of the chasm is near the hotels, and the
river there flows over a mile below them.<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
The Ca&ntilde;on walls are the delight of geologists,
who find there in orderly arrangement
(stratum upon stratum in banded colors)
the deposits of the successive ages of the
earth from the archaean granite to the lava
flows of recent geologic time. A succinct
and readable account of the geological
features of the Ca&ntilde;on will be found in the
United States Geological Survey&rsquo;s admirable
Guide Book of the Western United
States, Part C&mdash;a book of especial value
to the car-window observer on the Santa
Fe route.</p>
<p>Trains to the Ca&ntilde;on are arranged so that
travelers may reach it in the early morning
and leave the same evening. In a way this is
unfortunate, for it offers a temptation, almost
irresistible to an American tourist, to
&ldquo;do&rdquo; the place in a day and go on to some
other sight. Of course no one <i>can</i> do it in a
day, but he can do certain things, and he
can get a notion of the general scheme.
Three days at least would best be planned
for, and of course more still would be better.
The principal features that should not be
missed, may be summed up as follows: A
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
horseback trip down into the Ca&ntilde;on by
either Bright Angel Trail or the Hermit
Trail; the drive (15 miles the round) over
the Hermit Rim road; the auto trip (26
miles the round) to Grand View Point.
There are, moreover, several short drives of
four or five miles by public coach to vantage
points along the rim, costing a dollar or two
per passenger; and of course walks innumerable,
among which that to Hopi Point,
about 2 miles northwest from the railway
terminus, is particularly to be recommended
for its sunset view of the Ca&ntilde;on. Another
pleasant short rim walk is to Yavapai Point,
1&frac12; miles to the eastward. From both these
points the view is superb.</p>
<p>The trip down the Bright Angel<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a> trail to
the river and back is an all day jaunt. To
the tenderfoot it is a somewhat harrowing
experience to be borne downward at an
angle of 45 degrees more or less on the back
of a wobbling animal, whose head at times
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
hangs over eternity, and whose only footing
is on a narrow shelf scratched out of a precipitous
wall of the Ca&ntilde;on. However, as
nothing tragical happens, and as there is no
escape once you are started on the <i>descensus
Averni</i>, you soon find enjoyment in the
novel trip, zigzagging ever downward
through successive geologic ages marked by
rock strata in white, red, brown and blue.</p>
<p>Something over half way down there is
a grateful let-up, when the trail runs out
upon a plateau watered by a musical little
brook. This place is known as &ldquo;The Indian
Garden.&rdquo; It is enclosed on three sides by
lofty reddish walls, and here some Havasupai
Indians are said to have had in comparatively
recent times a village, and to have
cultivated the land. Long before them, however,
<i>en el tiempo de cuanto ha</i>, as the
Pueblo story tellers say in poetic Spanish
(&ldquo;in the time of how long ago&rdquo;), another
race must have tilled the same soil, as the
near-by cliffs maintain numerous remains
of rock dwellings and other evidences of
human occupancy. It is a pleasant, flowery,
romantic spot, this Indian Garden, in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
Ca&ntilde;on&rsquo;s crimson heart, with its fascinating
environment of rock sculpturings that seem
the towers, palaces and temples of an enchanted
city awaiting the lifting of a spell.
At the plateau&rsquo;s outer edge you have a
stupendous view of the colossal gorge and
the muddy torrent of the river, leaping and
roaring 1300 feet below. You may make
the Indian Garden the limit of your descent,
or you may continue to the river itself, corkscrewing
down among the crevices and rockbound
ways and echoes of the inexorable
wall until you come out upon a little beach,
past which, more terrible than beautiful, the
savage torrent thunders and cascades and
tears its course to freedom. You will be
glad to get into the blessed upper world
again, but you would not have missed the
experience for a greater cost of clambering.</p>
<p>The Hermit Rim road is a first-class modern
highway (so far barred, thank heaven,
to automobiles), extending about 7&frac12; miles
westward from El Tovar by way of Hopi
Point to the Hermit Basin. Part of it
passes through beautiful stretches of park-like
forest, emerging upon the dizzy brink
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
of the Ca&ntilde;on with magnificent outlooks over
chasm and river to distant mountains and
cloud-piled sky. If you enjoy walking, it is
pleasant to do this trip one way in the public
coach and the other afoot by way of Rowe&rsquo;s
Well. The Hermit Rim Road ends at the
head of a comparatively new trail to the
river, a sort of trail <i>de luxe</i>, 4 feet wide
and protected by a stone wall very reassuring
to the apprehensive. As on the Bright
Angel trail, there is a plateau midway. Here
a public camp is maintained, where accommodations
for an over-night stay may be
had. From this camp to the river must be
done afoot&mdash;an easy grade, it is said, but I
cannot speak from personal knowledge.
There is a trail connecting the lower portions
of Hermit and Bright Angel trails,
so that one may go to the river by one route
and return by the other. This consumes
3 days ordinarily, and must be taken as a
camping trip with its concomitant ups and
downs. It is hardly to be recommended to
any but the reasonably robust&mdash;and good
natured!</p>
<p>Grand View Point, 13 miles east of El
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
Tovar&mdash;a beautiful drive that may be done
by motor car through the Coconino Forest&mdash;is
the terminus of the old-time stage route
from Flagstaff. The view at the point is
perhaps the finest of all&mdash;quite different
from that at El Tovar and more extended:
owing to the greater width between the main
walls of the Ca&ntilde;on; to the fact that the
river here makes a sharp turn to the north;
and the further fact that the relative lowness
of the eastern wall of the bend opens
up a vista towards the desert, which at El
Tovar is hidden. The Grand View round
trip with a look-around at Grand View
Point may be done in half a day from El
Tovar, but if one can afford to give a day
or two to it, the material is here to be worth
the extra time. Here is a hotel to care for
you. Particularly of interest is the trail to
Moran Point, some half dozen miles to the
east, an exquisite outlook and the view point
of Thomas Moran&rsquo;s famous picture of the
Ca&ntilde;on which occupies a place in the Capitol
at Washington. There is a trail down to
the river from Grand View Point, and another
by way of Red Ca&ntilde;on, heading a little
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
to the west of Moran Point. A connecting
trail at the bottom of the Ca&ntilde;on makes it
possible to descend by one trail and return
by the other, if one goes prepared to camp
by the river. There are, by the way, several
varieties of fish in the Colorado, one, the
so-called Colorado salmon,<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a> being a good
table fish, though the catching involves no
sport, as it is not gamey.</p>
<p>The Grand Ca&ntilde;on may be visited at any
season, though in winter there is often snow
upon the rim and upper levels. Usually
there is not enough to interfere seriously
with reaching the various points of interest;
and as one descends into the gorge, one
soon passes out of wintry into warmer and
still warmer conditions. Even in December
some flowers will be blooming in the bottom
of the Ca&ntilde;on. July and August constitute
the usual summer rainy season, when frequent
thunderstorms are to be expected,
particularly in the afternoons. They are
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
usually of short duration. The atmospheric
effects accompanying and succeeding them
are often magnificent.<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a></p>

<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">MONTEZUMA&rsquo;S CASTLE AND WELL, WHICH MONTEZUMA NEVER SAW</span></h2>
<p>If you happen never to have speculated
in copper or archaeology and are not a
Southwesterner, it is quite likely that you
have not heard of the Verde Valley. It is a
somewhat sinuous cleft up and down the
very center of Arizona, holding in its heart
the Verde River (<i>el Rio Verde</i>, or Green
River, of the Spaniards) which has its source
under the San Francisco Peaks, and after
150 miles or so through cramped ca&ntilde;ons
and sunny bottomlands of more or less fertility,
joins the Salt River about 50 miles
east of the latter&rsquo;s junction with the Gila.
On the western edge of its upper reaches are
the smelter towns of Clarkdale and Jerome,<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a>
and the famous copper mines of the United
Verde Company. Across the valley from
these, to the eastward and bordering the
great Mogollon Mesa that divides the basin of
the Little Colorado and the Gila, is that Red
Rock country referred to in a previous chapter,
together with the Verde&rsquo;s beautiful tributary,
Oak Creek; while some 30 miles to
the south there enters the Verde another
stream called Beaver Creek. It is upon the
latter the scene of this present chapter is
laid.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Today the valley of the Verde maintains
but a sparse population. Here and there is
a white man&rsquo;s hamlet; here and there are
wickiups of the now peaceable Apaches; and
where, between the cliffs that wall in much
of the valley, there is level land enough to
make farming operations possible, there are
scattering ranches strung along. Time was,
however, when the valley was the home of
an abounding aboriginal population. How
long ago that was no one knows, further
than that it was before&mdash;and probably long
before&mdash;the 16th century Spaniards discovered
the Upper Verde and reported silver
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
outcroppings there. The bordering cliffs
and hilltops are dotted and honeycombed
with the ruins of pueblos, stone fortresses
and cave dwellings to an extent that has
made the region unusually attractive to the
archaeologists. Two of these prehistoric
remains on Beaver Creek hold especial interest
also for the lay traveler. They are
the so-called Casa Montezuma, or Montezuma&rsquo;s
Castle, and Montezuma&rsquo;s Well. The
former, a strikingly fine example of a cliff
ruin as imposing in its way as a castle on the
Rhine, has been made a National Monument
and is under such protection of the United
States government as goes with a printed
notice tacked upon a tree nearby, for there
is no resident guardian. The Well is upon
a private ranch 8 miles north of the Castle.
It need hardly be said that Montezuma,
whose name is popularly joined to both, had
nothing whatever to do with either; nor indeed
had any Aztec, though people who get
their ancient history from newspapers, will
tell you that the ruins are of Aztec construction.
Both Castle and Well are close to the
Arizona State Highway, and may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
reached by a 50 or 60 mile drive from Flagstaff,
or half that from Jerome. Another
way to reach them is from Prescott by automobile
livery. Yet another is by rail from
Prescott to Cherry Creek (Dewey Postoffice)
on the Crown King branch of the
Santa Fe, and then by auto-stage through
the picturesque Cherry Creek Ca&ntilde;on 32
miles to Campe Verde on the Verde River.
Campe Verde was formerly an army post of
importance during the Apache wars, but is
now peaceful enough for the most pacific,
maintaining a hotel, a garage, a barber shop,
an ice-cream and soda-pop saloon, a store
or two, and similar amenities of 20th century
living as delightful as unexpected in
this out-of-the-way corner of our country.</p>
<p>And I think here is as good a place as any
to say a word about the modern Southwestern
mail stage. It is, of course, motor-driven
in this mechanical age, and lacks the
peculiar dash and picturesqueness of the
4- and 6-horse vehicles of other days.
Nevertheless, much of the charm that enveloped
western stage travel then clings to
the modern auto-stage. There is the same
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
immersion in glorious, wild scenery; the
same thrill of excitement as you spin down
mountain grades and around curves with a
ca&ntilde;on yawning hungrily beside you; the
same exhilaration of association with fellow
passengers of types foreign to Broadway or
La Salle Street; many times there is the
same driver, who, surrendering the ribbon
for a steering wheel, has not at all changed
his nature. The seat beside him is still the
premium place, and if he takes a fancy to
you, he will exude information, anecdote
and picturesque fiction as freely as a spring
its refreshing waters. To travel a bit by
stage, when occasion offers, gives a flavor
to your Southwestern outing that you will
be sorry to have missed. Besides, it sometimes
saves you money and time.</p>
<p>From Camp Verde to Montezuma&rsquo;s
Castle is a pleasant 3 mile jaunt. Of course
you may miss the trail, as I did, and walk
six, but if you keep close to Beaver Creek,
with a sharp eye ahead, you can detect the
ruin from nearly a mile away, snugly ensconced
high up in a niche of a pale cliff,
overlooking the valley. It is a comparatively
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
small ruin, but there is a charm in its very
compactness. And there is the charm, too,
of color, the general tone of the buildings
being pink set in a framing of white. The
base is about 75 feet above the level of the
creek that flows at the foot of the cliff&mdash;flows,
that is, when water happens to be in
it, which is not always. The structure itself
is perhaps 30 feet high, with substantial
squared walls of masonry, and is in 5
stories, access from one to another being
either by openings in the ceilings or by modern
ladders fastened against the outside
walls. How the ancients managed the
ascent from the ground, there is none to tell
us. An interesting feature is a bowed parapet
or battlement (the height of one&rsquo;s
shoulder), which surmounts the fourth
story, and from below hides the fifth story
rooms which are placed well back against
the innermost part of the cliff recess and
roofed by its overhang. Be sure you climb
to that battlemented upper story (it will be
no easy job, for you have to swing yourself
up to it through the ceiling of the fourth),
and leaning upon the parapet, enjoy the
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
solitude that stretches before you&mdash;from the
sycamores lining Beaver Creek at the cliff&rsquo;s
foot, across the mesquite-dotted mesa, and
the green bottomlands of the Verde to the
long purple range of the Black Hills in the
dim southwest. If any sound there be, it
is the whisper of the wind in the trees far
below, or the cooing of the wild doves,
which haunt the place. So do bats, and a
certain queer acidulous smell that pervades
the rooms is attributable to them. As you
walk about, your feet stir up the dust of
ages. Here and there on the mud-plastered
walls are human finger prints dried in the
material when it was laid on by prehistoric
hands. In some of the rooms, particularly
in certain cave dwellings (which, following
the natural ledges, you will find scooped out
of the tufa cliff beside the Castle), the ceiling
and walls are blackened still with soot
from the smoke of pre-Columbian fires.
You may pick up bits of pottery, as you
stroll, corn-cobs wizened of the ages, broken
metates, or malpais rubbing stones, mute
reminders of the human drama once enacted
here. The airy battlement is pierced
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
with downward-pointing loopholes through
which arrows were doubtless shot at foes
below. It is this abounding and evident
human touch, this mystery of a long vanished
human life, that lends to Southwestern
travel a unique fascination, reaching to
something in us that is not awakened by
purely natural aspects more sublime but
disassociated from man. In spite of the
fact that men will kill one another, mistreat,
enslave and exploit one another, men never
lose a supreme interest in men; stronger
than all is the yearning of the human heart
for other human hearts. Is it love outwearing
love&rsquo;s antithesis?</p>
<p>Montezuma&rsquo;s Well is 8 miles further up
Beaver Creek, and is reached by a public
highway quite practicable for automobiles
when the fords of the creek are not running
high water. You pass a ranch every mile
or so, and the Well itself is found to be
situated inside the wire fences of one. After
the hospitable and unexacting solitude of
Montezuma&rsquo;s Castle, you will experience a
bit of a shock, perhaps, at the fences and in
finding that a fee of half a dollar is imposed
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
for entrance to the Well. Nevertheless
the sight is worth the money. Proceeding
from the ranch house across an eighth
of a mile of open, treeless mesa, you come
quite without warning, to a crater-like<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a>
opening 500 feet across, yawning at your
feet. Its walls drop almost perpendicularly
some 60 feet or more to a round pool of
clear water steel blue, except around the
margins, where accumulations of pondweed
give it a brown tinge. There is a precipitous,
stony trail down which you may pick your
way to the water&rsquo;s edge; and there, as in
the bottom of a colossal mush-bowl, you are
hid from the world and the world from you.
Catclaw and wild grape, hackberry and wild
walnut and salt-bush make a scrubby cover
roundabout, with datura and cleome and
blooming wild tobacco adding a flower-touch.
There is here as at Montezuma&rsquo;s
Castle a peculiar sense of loneliness and
silence&mdash;broken only by an occasional bird
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
note, or the hum of vagabond bees. In the
clear, still waters of the pool are reflections
of the cliffs, and raising your eyes to them
you recognize in the southern side a few
squat little stone houses wedged in between
the strata of the rock walls. You can, if
you choose, easily climb to some of them,
and stooping through the small doorways
get a taste of what it was like to be a cliff
dweller. At the north end of the pond
there is a thicket of willows and cottonwoods,
and there the waters find their exit
by an underground passage that would lead
them into Beaver Creek (which flows beyond
the hill) were it not that they are
diverted to irrigate the ranch lands. Near
this place of disappearance, is a very interesting
feature of the Well&mdash;a series of
natural caverns reaching far back under the
hill, forming an irregular dwelling of many
rooms, with occasional bits of built-in wall
of mud-plastered stone. Upon such a wall
at the very entrance of the cavern is the
tiny imprint of a child&rsquo;s hand, left we must
suppose, by some prehistoric toddler steadying
itself&mdash;how many, many centuries ago,
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
who can tell?&mdash;against the freshly plastered
surface, just as a baby, uncertain of its feet,
would do to-day. At the time Mr. Chas.
F. Lummis wrote his fascinating volume,
&ldquo;Some Strange Corners of our Country,&rdquo;
and described Montezuma&rsquo;s Castle and Well,
the precious imprint was perfect; but some
witless latter-day visitor has pecked out the
palm with his vandal jack-knife, destroying
in a moment what Time, the arch-destroyer,
had respected for centuries. Still the marks
of the baby fingers were left when I visited
the place a year ago and I hope still are, to
link the fancy tenderly with that ancient
people, our elder brethren.</p>
<p>The proprietor of the Well, Mr. W. B.
Back, will guide you about and light you
into the cavern&rsquo;s recesses, piloting you with
a lantern through passages so low and
narrow at times that you must go almost on
hands and knees until he brings you, far
within, into a spacious and utterly dark
rock-chamber with a stream of living water
coursing musically through it, where further
investigation is barred. He will also transport
you in an anachronous row-boat across
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
the bosom of the Well. It seems the
soundings deepen suddenly from 80 feet at
the outer part to 500 feet and no bottom at
the center. There the water rises as in a
funnel from its unknown source. At the
outlet beyond the hill the waters gush from
beneath a high, darkling cliff in an impetuous
stream that varies little in volume
throughout the year, the measurement being
about 112 miner&rsquo;s inches. Your guide takes
you there, too (passing on the way the
ruins of an ancient pueblo that once occupied
the mesa near the Well&rsquo;s edge), and
you will enjoy the sight of that brisk little
torrent fringed with a riot of maiden-hair
fern and columbine, and darkened by the
shadows from huge sycamores that foregather
about it. The ancient Well-dweller,
knew perfectly the value of that water and
led it by ditches, the remains of which you
may yet see, to irrigate their corn- and bean-fields
a mile away. Apaches, who within
recent years have been the only Indians
dwelling in the region, profess no knowledge
of the people who built the houses here.
Mr. Back (who, by the way, in 1889 filed as
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
a homesteader on the land about the Well
including the Well itself as a water right)
informed me that the Apaches regard the
place with disfavor. &ldquo;<i>Aqua no &rsquo;ueno</i>,&rdquo; one
old man told him, &ldquo;water no good. Long
time ago, you <i>sabe</i>, three Indian <i>mujeres</i> all
same women, you <i>sabe</i>, she swim out in
water, and go round and round, you <i>sabe</i>,
in the middle, and by &rsquo;em by, she go down,
all three. Never come back. No, no&mdash;<i>no
&rsquo;ueno</i>.&rdquo; The water is warmish, but quite
drinkable&mdash;if you can forget about those
Apache ladies who are still in it.</p>
<p>It would seem reasonable that so remarkable
a natural phenomenon as is the Well,
situated in a region as populous with aborigines
as the Verde Valley once was, would
have a place in Indian folk lore; and as a
matter of fact Dr. J. W. Fewkes<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a> has
learned that the Hopis know of its existence,
and claim it as the home of some of
their ancestors. Moreover, the tales of
some of their old men indicate that they
regard the place as the house of the Plumed
Serpent, a divinity peculiarly dear to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
desert dwelling Hopis of today, as the
guardian of the waters and springs. Indeed,
it is, perhaps, as a shrine of the divine that
the Well is most truly to be considered; and
in view of the extensive pueblo that once
flourished on the rim, it may be that the
houses of the Well walls were used in connection
with religious observances rather
than as a habitation of the common people.</p>

<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">SAN ANTONIO</span></h2>
<p>If you are a Southwesterner, born or
naturalized, returning from a visit &ldquo;back
East,&rdquo; your spirits rise with a jump when
the trainmen call out &ldquo;San Antone!&rdquo; For
this is the frontier of your own dear country,
and you feel the thrill that goes with
getting home again and being among your
own people. Dusty and a bit down at the
heel in spots is San Antonio, you think?
Yes, son, but it is picturesque; and there are
adobes and Mexicans, Stetson hats and cart-wheel
dollars once more, and it is where the
Southwest begins, if you are westbound on
the S. P.</p>
<p>San Antonio more than anywhere else in
Texas has an Old World atmosphere. The
former Spanish capital of the province, there
are parts of it that impart to the visitor
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
much the same feeling that Monterey, that
other Spanish capital, gives him in California&mdash;the
feeling that <i>may be</i> this is the
United States, but it needs to be demonstrated.
Of course, being a city of 100,000
people and commercially important, it has
its well-groomed, American side, but unless
you are in San Antonio merely in quest of
health and comfort,<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a> it is not that spick-and-span
side that appeals to your traveler&rsquo;s
taste. You will prefer those streets, irregular
and even unpaved (often their Spanish
names still clinging to them), of the older
quarters, where cracked one-storied adobes
in open sunshine, elbow stately old tree-embowered
mansions, whose tangled gardens
seem to hide in their unkempt corners
untold romances. You will like the Mexican
quarter with its queer little shops, and the
market square with its picturesque crowds
of swarthy <i>peones</i>, donkeys and country
teams of odd sorts, its squatting street venders
of <i>tortillas</i>, cakes, <i>dulces</i>, songbooks,
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
religious pictures and shoe-strings. You
will like, too, the bridges over the little river
that winds cosily about through the midst
of the town, and the waterside lawns where
trees cast a comfortable shade and summer
houses invite to tea <i>al fresco</i>. There are
literally dozens of those bridges, with railings
at a convenient height to lean your
elbows on and dream away an idle half-hour.
Moreover, you will like the many charming
parks and plazas, where you may sit under
a palm tree and enjoy the passing tide of
open-air life and make more acquaintances
in half an hour than you would in New York
in a year.</p>
<p>The Main Plaza is dominated by the
cathedral of San Fernando, which dates
from 1738, though little of the original
structure remains&mdash;most of the present
building having been constructed about half
a century ago. What is left of the original
church is in the rear, backing on another and
larger square, the old <i>Plaza de Armas</i>, or
Military Plaza as it is now called.</p>
<p>Modern San Antonio has risen out of the
consolidation of the presidio of San Antonio
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
de B&eacute;jar, the Mission of Antonio de
Valero (both mission and presidio founded
in 1718) and the <i>villa</i>&mdash;a form of Spanish
municipality&mdash;of San Fernando, founded in
1730. The Mission, after abandonment as
a religious institution, was turned into a
fortress and barracks, and acquired the
name of Alamo.<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a> The Church of the Mission
and what is left of the main building
of the Fort are the most famous historical
buildings in the city. They face on the
Alamo Plaza, and are of such unique interest
as to draw, in themselves, many visitors
to San Antonio; for they are in a sense
to Texas what Faneuil Hall is to New England,
the cradle of its liberty. Late in 1835,
when Texas was still a part of Mexico, San
Antonio was stormed and captured by a
band of insurgent American-Texans under
the leadership of &ldquo;Old Ben&rdquo; Milam, who was
killed in the fight. (You will see his statue
in Milam Square, if you are interested
enough to look it up). The Alamo, which
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
was well outside the San Antonio of those
days, was surrendered with the city. Here
the Texans later entrenched themselves, and
in February and March of the following
year were besieged for 12 days by 4000
Mexicans under General Santa Ana. Of
the Texans, there were less than 200, including
some women and children. Refusing
to surrender, every man of them was
killed in the final assault upon the place, the
only survivors (according to H. H. Bancroft)
being 3 women, 2 children and one
negro boy servant. &ldquo;Remember the Alamo&rdquo;
became the war-cry of the Texans in the
subsequent struggle that ended in the independence
of the province.</p>
<p>The little Alamo Church and part of the
main building that we see to-day, form only
a small portion of the establishment that
existed in 1836 and was occupied by the
Texan defenders. Besides this church part
(now maintained as a public monument)
there was the large two-story <i>convento</i>-fortress
divided into rooms and used as
armory and barracks, part of which now
exists and is cared for by the State of Texas;
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
also a prison building and courtyard; the
whole covering between 2 and 3 acres. Prominent
among the Alamo defenders was that
picturesque character and popular Southwestern
hero, Davy Crockett. Another was
James Bowie, to whom many authorities attribute
the invention of the famous knife
that bears the Bowie name, but Bancroft
says it was Rezin Bowie, a brother of James,
who originated it. These and others of the
participants in the Texan war of independence
are commemorated in the names of
streets, parks and public houses throughout
the city. As for the Alamo, it is bait in all
sorts of business ventures&mdash;giving name to
saloons, suspenders, grocery stores, restaurants,
lodging houses and what not.</p>
<p>Next to the Alamo, the sightseer (unless
an enthusiasm for matters military takes
him straight to San Antonio&rsquo;s famous army
post, Sam Houston), will find worth while
a visit to the old Franciscan Missions, now
in ruins, that are strung along the San Antonio
River to the south of the city. There
are four of these, the first about 2 miles
from the Alamo, the rest at similar intervals
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
of a couple of miles. Americans have got
in the way of calling them, in numerical
fashion, First, Second, Third and Fourth
Missions, respectively, to the neglect of their
fine old Spanish names. The First, which is
on the southern outskirts of the city, and
may be reached by a moderate walk from
a street car line, is the Mission <i>Nuestra
Se&ntilde;ora de la Pur&iacute;sima Concepcion de Acu&ntilde;a</i>
(Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception,
of Acu&ntilde;a). From quite a distance one
catches sight of its twin square towers with
pyramidal tops and its high dome peeping
above a tangle of mesquite, chinnaberry and
pecan trees, and sprawling juisache bushes.
A Mexican family lives in an end of the
ruined <i>convento</i> part, and a small fee is
charged for showing the inside of the
church and permitting you to climb the
belfry for a fine view over the country. The
fa&ccedil;ade is interesting with much curious
sculpturing. The knotted cord of St. Francis
winds above the austere polygonal &ldquo;arch&rdquo; of
the doorway, upon which is this Spanish inscription:
<i>A su patrono y princessa con estas
armas atiende esta mission y defiende el</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
<i>punto de su pureza</i>. (With these arms this
Mission attends her Patroness and Princess
and defends the state of her immaculateness.)
This is an obvious allusion to the controversy
long maintained among old-time
theologians concerning the dogma of the
Virgin Mary&rsquo;s immaculate conception&mdash;a
doctrine defended and preached by the Franciscans
from the first. In the corners immediately
above the arch are two medallions,
the one bearing an unusual form of
the Franciscan Order&rsquo;s coat-of-arms&mdash;the
Saviour&rsquo;s naked arm and the sleeved arm
of St. Francis nailed together to the Cross;
the other carved in the semblance of five
blood-drops, to symbolize perhaps the stigmata
of St. Francis. Upon the keystone is
another elaborate embellishment now much
worn by the elements. The central figure of
this is plainly representative of the consecrated
elements in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper&mdash;a
slender Spanish chalice surmounted by the
Sacred Host. Worn figures at the sides
of the chalice may have represented
clouds or adoring angels. The whole carving
of the keystone obviously typifies the
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
Church&rsquo;s missionary purpose. The front
was once gaily frescoed in red, yellow, blue
and orange; but Time&rsquo;s remorseless hand
has fallen heavily on that. Begun in 1731,
the building was not completed until 1752.
After Mexican independence from Spain
was accomplished, this Mission as well as
the others, was abandoned and was not infrequently
used by both Mexican and United
States troops for barracks and stables.
Some 30 years ago Bishop Neraz of San
Antonio had La Pur&iacute;sima Concepcion cleared
of rubbish and re-dedicated to Our Lady of
Lourdes.<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>The Second Mission, properly called San
Jos&eacute; de Aguayo, was the first founded of
the four, dating from 1720. It was 11
years a-building, and the date of its completion,
March 5, 1731, seems to have determined the beginning of the remaining
three Missions in the chain, all of which were
founded on their present sites in that same
year.<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a> It was in its day the most flourishing
of the Texas Missions, as, in its ruins, it is
the most beautiful. The builder indulged to
the uttermost his love of florid carving, and
the broken fa&ccedil;ade of the roofless church is a
marvel of ornate sculpturing&mdash;of saints, life
size or in bust, cherubs&rsquo; heads and flaming
hearts, volutes and arabesques and conchoids
innumerable. But it is good sculpture
and an amazing thing that it should
have been wrought to the glory of God in
that wilderness of what was Northern
Mexico, near two centuries ago. Doubtless
it was the work of some artisan (I have read
that his name was Juan Huisar) brought up
from Old Mexico where such ecclesiastical
art was encouraged from the beginning of
the Spanish occupation; and for assistants
Indians were employed. Around the corner
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
from this front is a window in the baptistry
that makes you exclaim for the beauty of it,
so exquisite is it in its sculptured setting, so
delicate and of so simple loveliness is its
<i>reja</i>, or grating of wrought iron. And about
it in the broken chinks of crumbling masonry
is a fern garden of Nature&rsquo;s own sowing, of
a sort that thrives in the sunshine and aridity
of the Southwest and nowhere else, a species
that botanists call <i>Notholaena sinuata</i>. The
Mission is quite abandoned now save for an
occasional service at a modest little altar in
one room. A neighboring Mexican family
has the key and supplies a guide.</p>
<p>These two Missions are usually all the
hurrying tourist sees; but an hour more, if
you are in an automobile, is enough to afford
a glance at the other two, which, if less interesting,
are still a pleasant adventure. The
Third (6 miles from San Antonio) is Mission
<i>San Juan Capistrano</i> (Saint John of
Capistrano, in Italy), and the Fourth is <i>San
Francisco de la Espada</i> (Saint Francis of the
Sword). The last has undergone some restoration
to fit it for the resident priest, who
ministers to a Mexican flock quartered
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
roundabout. The entire round of the Missions
can be easily done by motor car in half
a day; but take a day to it, if you can spare
the time, picnic somewhere by the river, and
do the beautiful old places with leisure and
reverence. Surely one can do worse things,
to quote Sidney Lanier, &ldquo;than to steal out
here from town ... and dream back the
century and a half of strange, lonesome,
devout, hymn-haunted and Indian-haunted
years that have trailed past these walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annually during the last week of April,
there is held in San Antonio an open air
carnival called the Fiesta San Jacinto. The
name commemorates the decisive battle of
San Jacinto, fought April 21, 1836, between
Mexicans and Texans, and ending the War
of Texan Independence. Elaborate celebrations
mark the festival, which is almost as
well known in the Southwest as the New
Orleans Mardi Gras.</p>

<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GIANT CACTUS</span></h2>
<p>There are two Arizonas. There is that
wide, breezy plateau region of the north,
a mile and more above sea level, where our
travels so far have been; and there is the
much lower desert region of the south slanting
downward from the Gila River to Sonoran
Mexico, from which country there is
little to distinguish it physically. This desert
region, known to the Spaniards as Pimer&iacute;a
Alta (that is, the upper country of the Pima
Indians), was the only portion of what was
afterwards called Arizona to possess a white
population until several years after our Mexican
War. The tourist to-day penetrates it
in two general ways. Near the Mexican
frontier the Southern Pacific transcontinental
line traverses it, passing through Yuma
and Tucson and reaching up to Phoenix by a
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
branch from Maricopa. From the north a
branch of the Santa Fe system runs southward
from Ash Fork through Prescott
directly to Phoenix.</p>
<p>Phoenix is the State capital, a very modern
little city dating from 1817, with a population
of perhaps 20,000. There is a touch
of poetry in the name, which was given to
symbolize the rising of a new civilization
from the ashes of that prehistoric culture
the evidences of whose existence cover so
much of Southern Arizona. Here, where
50 years ago was pure desert lorded over by
the giant Sahuaro&mdash;that huge tree-cactus
which is Arizona&rsquo;s State emblem&mdash;we find
today surrounding Phoenix a pleasant land
of ranches watered by full irrigation canals
flowing in the shade of palms and cottonwoods,
where besides the common staples of
potatoes, corn and alfalfa, there is the exotic
grace of the orange and the fig, the olive,
the date and the apricot. This is the valley
of the Salt River, whose waters are impounded
by the huge Roosevelt Dam, some
80 miles east of Phoenix. Travelers desirous
of studying desert reclamation will
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
find Phoenix a good center for their observations.</p>
<p>If you value your personal comfort, the
time to visit Phoenix is between November
and May. During the rest of the year the
weather normally is remorselessly hot to the
unacclimated. My own acquaintance with
the city began in August. In a hazy way I
had noticed something unaccustomed about
the look of the population, the men particularly,
but failed to analyze it until a sociable
street car conductor remarked to me,
&ldquo;Stranger here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my first
day.&rdquo; &ldquo;We always know strangers right
away,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You see, they wear
their coats.&rdquo; Then I took a fresh look
around and though it was a fairly crowded
street, I failed to see a man who was not in
his shirt sleeves. The winter and early
spring, however, are delicious with the
peculiar purity and dryness of the desert air
to which a touch of frost at night may give
added vitality.</p>
<p>That interesting 120 mile automobile
highway called the Apache Trail finds at
Phoenix its western terminus. Its eastern
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
end is at Globe, a mining town on modern
lines in the center of a rich copper district.<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a>
This point is connected by rail with Bowie,
124 miles distant, on the Southern Pacific
Railway. Transcontinental travelers by this
route, either east- or west-bound, are now
given the opportunity of varying their trip
by taking this motor drive over the Apache
Trail, linking up with the train again at the
point of ending. The feature of the motor
trip, which consumed 9 to 12 hours, is the
chance it yields the traveler to get a more
intimate acquaintance with the Arizona
countryside than is possible from a car window.
Mines and cattle ranges, stupendous
ca&ntilde;ons, strange rock-sculpturings in glowing
colors, the desert with its entrancing
vistas, its grotesque and often beautiful
plant-life, even a glimpse of prehistoric
ruins&mdash;all this the drive affords; and to it
is added the impressive sight of the Roosevelt
Dam with its beautiful, winding driveway
upon the breast and its exhibition of
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
man-made waterfalls and 30-mile lake, an
unoffended Nature looking indulgently down
from surrounding precipices and mountain
crests and seeming to say, &ldquo;Son, not so bad.&rdquo;
There is a hotel at the Dam, on a promontory
overlooking the water&mdash;and in the
water bass and &ldquo;salmon&rdquo; are said to be. A
stop-over here is necessary if you wish to
visit the Cliff Dwellings, 5 miles to the eastward,
officially known as the Tonto National
Monument.</p>
<p>The Apache Trail detour cuts the traveler
out of stopping off at one of the most interesting
little cities of the Southwest&mdash;Tucson.<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a>
It may be that not all will find
this oasis town, lapped in the desert and girt
about with low mountains, as much to their
liking as I do, but I believe it possesses
features worth going back on one&rsquo;s tracks
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
to see; for it has a decided character of its
own. With an out-and-out modern American
side, there is the grace of an historic
past, whose outward and visible sign is a
picturesque Spanish quarter in adobe, pink,
blue and glaring white, clustering about a
sleepy old plaza and trailing off through a
fringe of Indian <i>rancher&iacute;a</i> to the blazing
desert. The region roundabout is associated
with pretty much all the history that Arizona
had until it became part of the United States.
The Santa Cruz Valley, in which Tucson
lies, was a highway of travel during three
centuries between Old Mexico and the
Spanish settlements and Missions of Pimer&iacute;a
Alta. Through this valley or the
neighboring one of San Pedro (there is a
difference of opinion on this point), Brother
Marcos de Niza, the first white man to put
foot in Arizona, must have passed in 1539
on his way to Zu&ntilde;i&rsquo;s Seven Cities; and this
way, the following year, came Coronado
upon the expedition that made of New
Mexico a province of Spain. A century
later the region was the scene of the spiritual
labors of Padre Eusebio Francisco Kino, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
devoted Jesuit missionary to the Indians&mdash;a
man of mark in his time, to whom is credited
the founding of the Spanish Mission
San Francisco Xavier del Bac, about 9 miles
south of Tucson. The present beautiful
structure, however (Tucson&rsquo;s crack sight for
tourists), was not erected until long after
Padre Kino&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>San Xavier is, in itself, worth a stop-over
at Tucson. You may make the round trip
from the railway station in a couple
of hours by automobile, getting en route a
taste of genuine desert scenery, with its scattered
covering of creosote bush, mesquite,
cat&rsquo;s claw, ocotillo and sahuaro. The Mission
building is one of the most beautiful
examples of Spanish ecclesiastical architecture
in our country; and the pure white
structure, lonely in the desert, its glistening
walls and stately towers and dome silhouetted
against a sapphire sky, makes a
striking sight, oriental in its suggestion.
The church part is still used for religious
services, and other portions form the residence
of Sisters of a Catholic order who
conduct a school for the children of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
Papago Indians. The primitive habitations
of the latter, scattered about within easy
access of the Mission, are the Mission&rsquo;s only
near neighbors. A small fee admits one to
the church. A feature of interest at the
front is the coat-of-arms in relief of the
Order of Saint Francis of Assisi.<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a> This is
evidence enough that the present structure,
which was begun in 1783 and finished in
1797, was erected by Franciscans, although,
as already stated, the Mission itself was
founded about a century previously by
Jesuits. In 1768 and for ten succeeding
years, the resident missionary at San Xavier
was Padre Francisco Garc&eacute;s, one of the
most remarkable characters in the Southwest&rsquo;s
history. An enthusiastic young priest
in his early thirties when he came to San
Xavier, and possessed of a powerful physique,
he journeyed on foot up and down the
valleys of the Gila and the Colorado (even
penetrating into California and to the Hopi
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
village of Oraibi), tirelessly searching out
Indians, and preaching to them Christ and
the gospel of reconciliation. He was indeed
the original Christian Pacifist of the Southwest,
urging upon the Indian tribes everywhere
that they should settle their differences
peaceably and live together as brothers.
To prove his faith he would never suffer a
military escort to accompany him in his
wilderness pioneering, but took only an
Indian companion or two as interpreter, and
a mule to carry his ecclesiastical impedimenta.
Neither would he bear any weapon
for defense, but went &ldquo;equipped only
with charity and apostolic zeal.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a> His
kindly, joyous character, so endeared him to
the aborigines, that, as he himself records,
a village would often refuse to supply him
a guide to the next tribe, wanting to keep
him for themselves. Under such circumstances,
he would set out alone. He was a
rare puzzle to those barbarians, both because
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
they found it difficult to decide whether
in his long gown and clean-shaven face
he was man or woman, and because he
strangely wanted nothing of them but
the chance to give them a free passport
to Heaven&mdash;an inexplicable sort of white
man, indeed!</p>
<p>While on your Mission pilgrimage, it will
be worth while to continue southward some
50 miles more to Mission San Jos&eacute; de
Tumac&aacute;cori. The road is fairly good and
about 7 hours will suffice for the round from
Tucson by automobile; or the train may be
taken on the Nogales branch of the Southern
Pacific to Tubac station, whence a walk
southward a couple of miles brings you to
the Mission.<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a> The buildings, mostly of
adobe, are in ruins and very picturesque
with a domed sanctuary and a huge square
belfry, now broken and dismantled. They
and a few acres surrounding them now form
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
the Tumac&aacute;cori National Monument, under
the care of the United States Government.
This Mission in the wilderness was once,
next to San Xavier, the most important in
what is now Arizona. It was established by
Jesuits in 1754, though the present church
building is of Franciscan structure of much
later date, having been completed in 1822,
replacing one destroyed by the ceaselessly
raiding Apaches.<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a> Of interest, too, in this
vicinity, is the ancient village of Tubac, 2
miles north of Tumac&aacute;cori. Here in the 18th
century was a Spanish presidio thought
needful for supplementing the preaching of
the friars by the argument of the sword.
To Californians and those interested in the
history of the Golden State, the place has an
appeal because here during several years Don
Juan Bautista Anza was commandant&mdash;the
sturdy soldier who conceived the idea of a
practicable overland route from Mexico
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
across the deserts to the Spanish settlements
on the California coast, and in 1775-6 convoyed
over this route the colonists who
founded San Francisco. Today Tubac is an
unpretentious little adobe hamlet sprawling
about a gravelly, sunny knoll, and looking
across the Santa Cruz River with its fringe
of billowy cottonwoods to the blue line of
the Santa Rita and San Gaetano ranges. At
Rosy&rsquo;s Caf&eacute; I got a modest but comforting
luncheon, and on your way to Tumac&aacute;cori
you, too, might do worse.</p>
<p>West of Tucson 65 miles is the little town
of Casa Grande, which takes its name from
one of the most famous prehistoric ruins in
the United States, standing about 18 miles
to the northeast, near the Gila River. If
you have a taste for prehistoric architecture,
you will enjoy Casa Grande, for it is <i>sui
generis</i> among our country&rsquo;s antiquities. If,
on the other hand, you are just an ordinary
tourist, you must decide for yourself
whether a half day&rsquo;s motor trip across the
desert to see a ruinous, cubical mud house
topped with a corrugated iron roof, in the
midst of a sunburnt wilderness, will or will
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
not be worth your while. What touches the
fancy is that here, centuries doubtless before
Columbus (perhaps before the time of
the Cliff Dwellers) dwelt and toiled an unknown
people whose remains are of a type
that possesses important points of difference
from those found elsewhere within the limits
of the United States, though similar ruins
exist in Mexico. Casa Grande is Spanish
for Great House, and is given to this ruin
because its outstanding feature is a huge
block of a building of three or four stories
in height, and thick walls of <i>caliche</i>&mdash;a mixture
of mud, lime and pebbles molded into
form and dried, somewhat as modern concrete
walls are built up. The unique character
of the Casa Grande caused it to be set
aside 25 years ago as a National Monument,
and important work has since been done
there by Government ethnologists, in the
way of strengthening and repairing the
crumbling walls and cleaning up the rooms.
Extensive excavations have also been made
close by, resulting in uncovering the foundations
of a numerous aggregation of houses
plazas, enclosing walls, etc. These reveal
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
the fact that in some age the place was a
walled city of importance, even if it was of
mud&mdash;a sort of American Lutetia, to which
Fate denied the glory of becoming a Paris.
The huge building in the center&mdash;the Casa
Grande&mdash;probably served partly as a religious
temple, but principally as a citadel
where in time of attack by enemies the people
took refuge. Access to the upper stories
was doubtless by ladders outside, as in
modern pueblos. Indeed, this is but one of
several walled-in compounds of buildings
that formerly existed in the Gila Valley, and
are now but shapeless heaps of earth. Some
of these close to the main Casa Grande ruin
have been excavated and their plan laid bare.
The remains of an extensive irrigation system
are still in evidence, water having been
drawn from the Gila.</p>
<p>The first white man of unimpeachable
record to see Casa Grande was that Padre
Eusebio Kino, of whom we heard at San
Xavier and who gave the ruin its Spanish
name. He learned of it from his Indians,
and in 1694 visited the place, saying mass
in one of its rooms. There is some reason
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
to identify the spot with Chichiticale, or
Red House, a ruin noted in the reports of
Fray Marcos de Niza and of Coronado, both
of whom probably passed not far from Casa
Grande on their way to Zu&ntilde;i, but most
scholars now reject this theory of identity.
After Kino the ruin was frequently examined
by explorers and written about up
to the American occupation. Anza and his
San Francisco colonists camped a few miles
distant, and the commandant with his two
friars, Padres Garc&eacute;s and Font, inspected
the place with great interest on October 31,
1775. Font in his diary gives a circumstantial
account of it, calling it <i>La Casa de
Moctezuma</i> (Montezuma&rsquo;s House), and
narrates a tradition of the neighboring Pima
Indians as to its origin. It seems<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a> that long
ago, nobody knows how long, there came to
that neighborhood an old man of so harsh
and crabbed a disposition that he was called
Bitter Man (<i>el Hombre &rsquo;Amargo</i>, in Padre
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
Font&rsquo;s version). With him were his daughter
and son-in-law, and for servants he had the
Storm Cloud and the Wind. Until then the
land had been barren, but Bitter Man had
with him seeds which he sowed, and with the
help of the two servants abundant crops
grew year after year, and were harvested.
It was these people who built the Great
House, and they dwelt there, though not
without quarrels because of Bitter Man&rsquo;s
character, so that even Storm Cloud and
Wind left him at times, but they came back.
After many years, however, all went away&mdash;whither,
who knows&mdash;and were heard of
no more forever.</p>
<p>Casa Grande may also be reached by conveyance
from Florence on the Arizona Eastern
Railway, from which point it is distant
a dozen miles or so. Owing to the extreme
summer heat of this desert country, the trip
to the ruin is most comfortably made in the
late autumn, winter or early spring. There
is a resident care-taker who acts as guide.</p>

<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Shall they say of you, you have been to
Rome and not seen the Pope?&rdquo; Yet that is
what will be said if you turn back at the
Colorado River and leave Southern California
out of your Southwestern travels.
However, few people do that. The fear is
that in their haste to reach that tourist playground,
they may neglect too much of what
the preceding chapters have dwelt upon.
Intent upon seeing the Pope, they may do
scant justice to Rome.</p>
<p>By Southern California is meant California
south of the Teh&aacute;chapi Mountains
and their western prolongation ending in
Santa Barbara County at the sea. It is not
a political division, but Nature&rsquo;s&mdash;in its
physical aspect differing quite markedly
from Central and Northern California.
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
Long regarded with a sort of mild contempt
by the Americans who settled Central California
and who habitually spoke of the
South as &ldquo;the cow counties,&rdquo; Southern California
has in the last quarter century attained
a reputation not short of gilt-edged.
Lonely, treeless plains and valleys and brush-clad
mesas that a comparatively few years
ago were counted desert and good for
nothing except for cattle ranges and sheep
runs, have become, with the development of
water, pleasant lands of fruitfulness supporting
a numerous and progressive population.
The extensive cultivation of the orange, the
lemon, the fig, the grape, the English walnut,
the apricot, the olive; the planting of the
eucalyptus, the palm and a hundred kinds of
exotic shade and ornamental trees; the dotting
of the landscape with villas of a distinguished
sort of architecture patterned on
Italian and Spanish models&mdash;all this has
wrought a transformation that makes even
more appropriate today than 25 years ago
the sobriquet of &ldquo;Our Italy&rdquo; given the
region by Charles Dudley Warner.</p>
<p>Here wealthy Easterners maintain winter
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
homes as they keep summer estates on the
Atlantic Coast, and less well-to-do folk&mdash;retired
farmers, tradesmen or professional
people&mdash;buy a bungalow and settle down to
the enjoyment of a good climate and the
luxury of having roses and green peas in
their winter gardens. Not only Americans
but those of other nationalities have discovered
that Southern California totals a
remarkable number of points in the problem
of comfortable living&mdash;a healthful and delightful
climate (notably in winter), a fruitful
soil capable of raising everything natural
to the temperate zone besides a large number
of things sub-tropical, a beautiful and
varied terrain embracing seaside, valley and
mountain, and an admirable system of
capital roads. For the tourist there is not
only the attraction of this beauty and comfort,
but there is the drawing of historic
interest, touched with that indefinable sense
of romance that attaches wherever Spain has
had a foothold. In Southern California as
elsewhere in the Southwest, that Spanish
flavor is very evident, manifested in the
presence of a considerable Spanish-speaking
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
population, in the remains of Spanish-built
Missions and ranch houses, and in the persistence
of Spanish geographic nomenclature.</p>
<p>The hub of Southern California is Los
Angeles, which in a generation has expanded
from a sleepy little half-Spanish pueblo of a
few thousand to a metropolis of half a million,
with a taste for the latest in everything
and the money to indulge it. It is the
natural center from which to do one&rsquo;s sightseeing,
though Pasadena, adjoining it on the
north, is almost as convenient and, indeed,
preferred by many who are not in a hurry
and prefer surroundings more rural. Pasadena
is a little city of 40,000, beautifully
situated on a shelving mesa at the base of the
Sierra Madre and overlooking the fertile
San Gabriel Valley. It is nationally famous
for its numerous fine estates and the winter
residences of wealthy Easterners; but outside
of that it possesses mile upon mile of
tree-lined streets where modest homes of the
bungalow type look out from a setting of
vine and shrub and flower. Each New
Year&rsquo;s Day the city becomes the objective
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
of tens of thousands of visitors to view the
Tournament of Roses, an outdoor fiesta
whose distinctive feature is a street floral
pageant.</p>
<p>From Los Angeles lines of transportation
radiate to all points of interest. You have
your pick of steam railways, electric lines,
auto-stages and ocean steamers. Hundreds
of miles of first class, hard-surfaced roads
make Southern California a motorist&rsquo;s paradise,
and automobiling is here so notable a
feature of tourist life that, if possible, the
traveler should make provision for it when
packing his pocket book. Public automobiles
are abundant and the prices reasonable
enough, from $1.50 per hour upward, with
special rates for trips. If you are able to
club with others for a car, you may find this
the cheapest form of travel. Maps and
specific information as to drives may be
had at offices of the Automobile Club of
Southern California.<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>For those who do not care for motoring
or find it too expensive, most of the desirable
points are reached by electric and steam
lines, or by auto-stages. There are several
daily excursions scheduled by the Pacific
Electric Railway, which afford at a minimum
of expense a satisfactory means of getting a
comprehensive idea of Southern California.
One of these, to Mount Lowe (a prominent
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
peak of the Sierra Madre), may be substituted
for the automobile drive up Mount
Wilson. The visit to San Juan Capistrano
Mission may be made by train, the railway
station being close by. There is a resident
priest and religious services are regularly
held in one of the restored rooms. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
Mission was founded in 1775, and the
church part&mdash;now a ruin, the result of an
earthquake in 1812&mdash;marked in its prime
the high-tide of Mission architecture in
California.</p>
<p>The Franciscan Mission establishments in
California are among the most interesting
historical monuments of our country; and
those of the southern end of the State remain
to-day especially noteworthy. Ten
miles from Los Angeles is Mission San
Gabriel (founded in 1771 on the bank of
the Rio Hondo a few miles east of the present
site, to which it was removed in 1775).
It was for many years a principal center of
civilization in the province, the settlement
antedating the founding of Los Angeles by
several years. Of the original establishment
little remains but the church part, which is
in a state of good preservation and serves
as a place of worship for a considerable congregation,
largely of Spanish descent. Mission
San Fernando (about 25 miles west of
the heart of Los Angeles) is deserted, save
by a caretaker. The fine corridored <i>convento</i>,
flush with the highway, is its most conspicuous
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
feature today, but the Mission was
once of notable extent. A cloistered walk
formerly connected the <i>convento</i> with the
ruined church in the rear. If you stroll on
past the church to the ancient olive orchard
beyond and look back, having the two date
palms there in your foreground, you will get
a charming picture of the noble old temple
where Padre &ldquo;Napoleon&rdquo; strove, during a
third of the Mission&rsquo;s existence, to steer his
dusky children heavenward. Apropos of
these California Missions (whose plan was
quite different from those of New Mexico
and Arizona) it should be borne in mind
that originally each consisted of a huge hollow
square of buildings, facing within on an
open courtyard. The church occupied part
or all of one side, the other sides consisting
of living rooms for the one or two padres
(the <i>convento</i> part), kitchens, store rooms,
shops where the neophytes were taught and
labored, and the <i>monjerio</i> or sleeping
apartment of the Indian widows and unmarried
girls of the Mission. Outside this
compound were the huts of the Indian converts,
arranged in streets and forming an
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
orderly village of sometimes a couple of
thousand souls.<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a></p>
<p>South of Los Angeles, 125 miles, is San
Diego, reached either by rail, steamer, or
automobile. If the last way is chosen, going
and returning may be done over different
highways, one following the coast, the other
running further inland via Riverside. Both
roads are excellent. Forty miles before
reaching San Diego, you pass within calling
distance of Mission San Luis Rey (St.
Louis, the King)&mdash;4 miles east of Oceanside,
a railroad stop where conveyance may
be had for the Mission. San Luis Rey was
founded in 1798 and in its proportions
rivaled San Juan Capistrano. It is still an
imposing establishment, though restored
with rather too heavy a hand to suit the
artistic sense. The situation is charming, on
a knoll in the midst of a noble valley, emerald
green in winter and spring, the San Luis
Rey River flowing close by the Mission. A
community of hospitable Franciscan brothers
occupies the premises, and religious services
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
are regularly held in the church. Twenty
miles further up the river (eastward), a
pleasant drive, is San Luis Rey&rsquo;s sub-mission
or <i>asistencia</i>, San Antonio de Pala,
which no lover of the picturesque should
miss visiting. White-walled and red-tiled,
the quaint little church with a remarkable,
white bell-tower set not on it but beside it,
is one&rsquo;s beau ideal of an old mission. The
setting, too, is satisfying. On every hand
are the mountains; a stone&rsquo;s throw away
ripples the little river; and clustered close by
is a picturesque village of about 300 Indians,
to whom a resident priest, with rooms in the
Mission, is <i>cura</i>. Both Mission San Luis
Rey and this outpost of Pala were constructed
by Indians under the supervision of
the famous Padre Peyri, one of the most
forceful and devoted of the early Franciscans
in California. He gave the best of his
life to his wilderness flock, and years after
his departure, the Indians, in reverence of
his memory, would still offer up their prayers
before his picture as before a saint&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>San Diego, a city claiming a population of
100,000, is spread over seaward-looking
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
hills affording a delightful view of the land-locked
Bay of San Diego and the Pacific
Ocean going down to China. The mountains
of Old Mexico, too, only 20 miles away,
make a feature in the prospect. If you are
in any doubt what to do in San Diego, you
need only stroll around to the neighborhood
of the Plaza, and you will be shown. Street
cars, automobiles, &ldquo;rubberneck&rdquo; busses and
tourist agency windows are hung with
notices of places to see and trips to take, and
the streets are sprinkled with uniformed officials
emblazoned with gold lace, to give
you details. You may have a good time on
any of these jaunts, if you are good-natured
and like a bit of roughing it (for San Diego&rsquo;s
vicinity has not as yet reached Los Angeles
County&rsquo;s excellence in roads); but to give
you a start I would itemize the following
as not to be overlooked:</p>
<p>The exquisite gardens at Balboa Park
(where the Panama-California Exposition
of 1915-16 was held), affording in epitome
a charming object lesson in what California
gardens offer both in exotic and native
plants; the drive to and along the headland
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
of Point Loma for the fine views; by ferry
across the bay to Coronado&rsquo;s famous hotel
and beach; the ride by railway or automobile
to La Jolla (pronounced <i>lah ho&acute; yah</i>), a
pleasant little seaside resort with interesting
cliffs and surf-drenched rocks; by street car
to Old Town (where San Diego had its
beginning), to visit the Estudillo house&mdash;a
former Spanish home intelligently restored
and interesting as a bit of old-time architecture
with its tiled inner corridors about a
flowery patio. It is locally known as
&ldquo;Ramona&rsquo;s Marriage Place,&rdquo; because it was
here, according to the novel, that the priest
lived who married Ramona and Alessandro.
On the hill back of Old Town once stood
Padre Jun&iacute;pero Serra&rsquo;s first Mission in California,
founded in 1769; but it is all gone
now, the site being marked by a large cross
made of the original red tiles that once
littered the ground. It is but a short walk
worth taking both for the view and for the
sentiment of standing on the spot where
white civilization in California had its beginning.
Five miles up the valley that
stretches eastward at your feet is what is
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
left of the second Mission (established in
1774). This historic building has been
sadly neglected and is but a ruined shell,
which only reverence for its past makes interesting.
Across the road from it is the
old olive orchard, believed to be the original
planting of the olive in the State.</p>
<p>San Diego&rsquo;s back country offers many interesting
trips by auto-stage or private car,
the roads being as a rule good but with the
ups and downs of a hilly region. There are
several good hotels in the mountains at a distance
of 60 miles or so from San Diego, so
that the night may be spent here if desired.
Pine Hills, Mesa Grande, and Warner&rsquo;s Hot
Springs may be mentioned as desirable objectives.
The trip by auto-stage or your
own car via Campo to El Centro or Calexico
(at the Mexican border) in the Imperial
Valley will prove an unforgettable experience.
The Imperial Valley is a depression
below sea-level in the Colorado Desert of
California, which after lying desolate for
ages has of late been made exceedingly productive
by diverting irrigation water to it
from the Colorado River. This trip had
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
best be made between November and May,
as the desert heat in summer and early
autumn is intense. If you have your own
car and desire the experience of more desert,
return may be made around the Salton Sea
through the Coachella Valley (where dates
are now extensively grown), to Palm
Springs and Riverside.</p>
<p>While we have rambled along the coast
between Los Angeles and San Diego, our
eyes will often have been caught by the
sight of a long, low island well out to sea.
It is Santa Catalina, whose reputation as a
sea-angler&rsquo;s paradise is world wide. It has
also a most delightful climate&mdash;its and San
Diego&rsquo;s being perhaps the most equable of
any on the Coast. The marine gardens that
line the shores are also of wide fame, and
are made visible by boats with glass bottoms,
through which one looks down into the
transparent waters of another world where
waving kelps and sea mosses are the forests
and bright colored fish, sea anemones, jelly
fish, sea cucumbers and other queer creatures
are the inhabitants. The trip thither and
return may be accomplished from Los
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
Angeles, between breakfast and evening dinner,
if you do not care to stay longer.</p>
<p>A hundred miles northwest of Los Angeles
lies Santa Barbara (a little city of 15,000),
rich in beautiful homes and flowery gardens.
It is delightfully situated with the ocean at
its feet and the Santa In&eacute;s Mountains at its
back, and may be reached from Los Angeles
either by train or by a picturesque motor
drive through valleys, over mountains and
beside the sea. Here is the best preserved of
all the existing Franciscan Missions in California&mdash;never
abandoned since its founding
in 1786, though now for many a year there
have been no Indians in its care. It is the
residence of a Franciscan community, and
the members in their long brown gowns and
white cord girdles may be seen any day at
their various tasks about the grounds&mdash;one
of which is the piloting of visitors through
the church.</p>
<p>Driving, horseback-riding, playing golf,
or simply sitting still and enjoying being
alive in the midst of fine scenery, are the
principal occupations of Santa Barbara&rsquo;s
visitors. Among the longer drives should
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
be mentioned the 40 miles to the Ojai Valley
by way of the lovely Casitas Passes, and the
45 miles across the Santa In&eacute;s Mountains to
the Mission Santa In&eacute;s in the valley of the
same name. The latter trip is made more
enjoyable if two days are taken to it, the
mountains being crossed by the San Marcos
Pass<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a> into the Valley of Santa In&eacute;s, famous
for its majestic oaks, and the night passed at
Los Olivos, 6 miles north of the Mission
Mattei&rsquo;s Tavern at Los Olivos, is one of the
most comfortable country inns in California.
The return should be made by the Gaviota
Pass and the seaside road back to Santa
Barbara. The Mission of Santa In&eacute;s (which
is Spanish for Saint Agnes, whose eve gives
title to Keat&rsquo;s immortal poem), is sight
enough to make the trip worth while&mdash;with
white walls, red-tiled roofs and flowery, corridored
front, in a valley rimmed about
with mountains. The Mission was long
abandoned and in ruins, but when the present
hospitable rector took charge some 15 years
ago, he began a careful restoration and with
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
his own hands did much of the necessary
labor to put it as we see it today.<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c17">A POSTSCRIPT ON CLIMATE, WAYS AND MEANS.</h2>
<p>While the climate of the Southwest is
characterized by abundant sunshine and a
low degree of relative humidity, it has
periods of considerable moisture precipitation.
In winter this takes the form of snow
in the northern and central portions of New
Mexico and Arizona (which lie at an elevation
of 5000 feet and more above sea level).
The snow, however, except upon the mountains,
disappears rather rapidly under the
hot sunshine of midday, so that the traveler
has a fair chance to sandwich his trips between
the storms. The mid-year precipitation
of rain is generally during July and
August, and throughout all parts of both
those States it descends usually in severe
electrical storms. These occur as a rule in
the afternoon and pass quickly, but while
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
they last they are apt to be very, very wet.
They are the occasion of sky effects of cloud
and rainbow wonderful enough to compensate
for whatever discomfort the rain may
cause. In most sections the summer temperatures
are on the whole agreeable, but in
the much lower altitudes of parts of southern
Arizona and New Mexico, desert conditions
largely prevail, with a degree of heat in
summer that is trying to sight-seers.</p>
<p>In Southern California climatic conditions
differ greatly from those east of the Colorado
River. The coast year is divided
naturally into a dry season and a wet&mdash;the
latter normally extending from October or
November to April or May. From about
mid-spring to about mid-autumn no rainfall
whatever is to be expected, except in the
high mountains where there are occasional
thundershowers during summer. The winter
precipitation comes usually in intermittent
rain-storms of perhaps two or three days&rsquo;
duration (on the higher mountains these
come as snow), the intervening periods
generally characterized by pleasant, sunshiny
days and by nights with temperatures
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
(particularly during December and January),
not infrequently as low as 30 degrees
Fahr. These minimums, however, rarely
hold over an hour or so; and curiously
enough, though they result in early morning
frosts, only the tenderest vegetation is killed,
the mercury rising rapidly after sunrise; so
that a great variety of garden flowers bloom,
and many vegetables mature, in the open
throughout the winter. A marked feature
of the California 24 hours is the wide difference
between the temperature at midday
and that at night, amounting to 35 or 40
degrees F. This condition is fairly constant
and to be counted on daily. Similarly there
is a very marked difference between shade
and sun. A respectful regard for this fact
will save the traveler many a bad cold. In
summer, though the mercury may run well
up into the 90&rsquo;s and sometimes even to over
100 degrees, the accompanying relative
humidity is low, so that it may be said that
as a rule one suffers less from heat on the
Pacific Coast than on the Atlantic at a dozen
degrees lower.</p>
<p>As regards clothing, a simple and safe rule
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
for travelers in the Southwest is to bring
with them the same sort that they would wear
in New York, season for season. No part
of the Southwest is tropical, or even Floridian.</p>
<p>In the matter of expenses, Southern California
has had a wider experience in catering
to tourists than Arizona and New Mexico
and its facilities are now thoroughly systematized,
so that the average man may, if he
chooses, live there about as cheaply as at
home, or he may have the most luxurious accommodations
at the larger resorts on a basis
that only the very wealthy are familiar with.
European plan is that most in vogue in California
hotels, and the one most satisfactory
for the traveler, who, in his rambles, often
finds himself at meal-time far from his
hostelry. Unless you want to pay more, you
may calculate on $1.00 to $1.50 a night for a
comfortable room. In Arizona and New
Mexico the sparser settlement of the country
results in plainer accommodations, but the
rates are reasonable&mdash;room $1.00 a day and
up; American plan rate under normal conditions
about $3.00 a day. At many points
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
in these two States the railways conduct
hotels for the accommodation of their
patrons, and they are, in my experience, uniformly
good.</p>
<p>The charge for saddle-horses varies
greatly. In out-of-the-way places where the
horses range for their feed, ponies may be
had for a dollar a day; but at the popular
resorts, the rent of a good mount is generally
in the neighborhood of $3.00 a day; it may
be even more. There is a similar irregularity
as to automobile rates. The latter are
largely influenced by the character of the
trip, as 50 miles on some roads would involve
greater expense to the owner than 100 miles
on others. A return of $15 or $20 a day
for a car is not infrequently considered satisfactory,
but harder trips naturally necessitate
a much higher charge. In bargaining
for transportation in the Southwest, where
it may be a day&rsquo;s journey between stopping
places, it is well to remember that the lowest
priced is not always the cheapest. It pays
to pay for responsibility.</p>

the latter case, they may succumb to the offer of a dime if
they cannot get 25 cents. It is only just and courteous to
ask permission of the subject (putting yourself in his place).

heavy crosses. Some of their exercises are held at the
crosses on these hill-top <i>calvarios</i> (calvaries). The Catholic

the time of the Spanish conquest, the tribe was too insignificant

rapidly, and in raids upon the Pueblos took many of the
latter prisoners. From these (the Pueblos had long been
weavers of native cotton) they picked up the textile art;
and then stealing sheep from the Spaniards, they inaugurated
the weaving of the woolen blanket. Only the women
of the tribe are weavers, and Doctor Matthews states that
in his time, some 30 years ago, they did it largely as an
artistic recreation, just as the ladies of civilization do embroidery

frontiersman of the 1830&rsquo;s and &rsquo;40&rsquo;s, identified with Fremont&rsquo;s
fourth and ill-fated expedition, which Williams undertook
to guide across the Rockies and failed because of
the snow and cold. A tributary of the Colorado River also
bears his name.

mountain with a cratered summit, the glowing red rock of
which it is made up giving the upper part of the mountain
the appearance at any time of day of being illumined by the
setting sun. It may be made the objective of a pleasant
half day&rsquo;s trip from Flagstaff.

House Ruin (20 miles west of Betata Kin and so named
because of certain Spanish inscriptions upon it dated 1661)
form what is called the Navajo National Monument. At
Kayenta, a post office and trading post of Messrs. Wetherill
and Colville some 20 miles southeast of Betata Kin, pack
outfits and guide may be secured to visit these ruins. Dr.
J. W. Fewkes&rsquo;s description, Bulletin 50, Bureau of American
Ethnology, should be consulted for details.

United Verde railroad.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_77" href="#fr_77">[77]</a>The name commemorates that lieutenant of Coronado&rsquo;s,
Don Pedro de Tovar, who in 1540 visited the Hopi villages,
where he learned of the existence of the Grand Ca&ntilde;on, and
carried the news of it back to Coronado at Zu&ntilde;i.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_78" href="#fr_78">[78]</a>The exact spot of this first view is not known&mdash;the point
that today bears the name of C&aacute;rdenas being a random
guess.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_79" href="#fr_79">[79]</a>The first complete exploration of the river ca&ntilde;ons was
made in 1869, by an expedition in charge of Major J. W.
Powell, the noted ethnologist and geologist. He had boats
especially built for the trip. It was an undertaking of
supreme danger, forming, as Mr. F. S. Dellenbaugh says
in his interesting &ldquo;Romance of the Colorado River,&rdquo; &ldquo;one
of the distinguished feats of history;&rdquo; for not one of the
pioneering party could have any conception of what physical
obstacles were before them when the boats set out at the
Ca&ntilde;on&rsquo;s head into the unknown. Powell was a Civil War
veteran and had but one hand. He made a second and more
leisurely trip in 1871-72.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_80" href="#fr_80">[80]</a>Bright Angel is the name given by the first Powell expedition
to a creek entering the river here from the north;
its bright, clear waters being in striking contrast to a turbid
little tributary discovered not long before, which the men
had dubbed &ldquo;Dirty Devil Creek.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_81" href="#fr_81">[81]</a>It is not a true salmon. Dr. David Starr Jordan identifies
it as <i>Ptychocheilus lucius</i>, and it is really a huge chub
or minnow. There is a record of one caught weighing 80
pounds; more usual are specimens of 10 and 12 pounds.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_82" href="#fr_82">[82]</a>An interesting trip with the Grand Ca&ntilde;on as a base
is to Cataract Ca&ntilde;on, a side gorge of the Grand Ca&ntilde;on
about 40 miles west of El Tovar. The trip may be made by
wagon to the head of the trail leading down into an arm
of Cataract Ca&ntilde;on, but the final lap&mdash;about 15 miles&mdash;must
be on horseback or afoot. At the bottom is the reservation
of a small tribe of Indians&mdash;the Havasupais&mdash;occupying a
fertile, narrow valley hedged in by high cliffs of red limestone.
There are numerous springs and the water is used
to irrigate the fields and peach orchards of the tribe. These
Indians are much Americanized, and live under the paternal
care of a local Government agency. A feature of the Ca&ntilde;on
is the number of fine water falls. To one exquisite one,
called Bridal Veil, it would be hard to find anywhere a
mate. A camping trip eastward from Grand View along
the rim to the Little Colorado Junction may also be made
a pleasant experience, rendered particularly glorious by the
desert views.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_83" href="#fr_83">[83]</a>Jerome is reached by a little railway from Jerome Junction
on the Ash Fork and Phoenix division of the Santa Fe;
Clarkdale, by a branch from Cedar Glade on the same
division. The Clarkdale branch threads for much of the
way the picturesque ca&ntilde;on of the upper Verde River.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_84" href="#fr_84">[84]</a>There is, however, no evidence of volcanic action in the
vicinity; so the depression&mdash;deep as it is&mdash;is doubtless the
result of solvent or erosive action of the waters of the
Well. (J. W. Fewkes, 17th Ann. Rep. Bureau of American
Ethnology.)

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_87" href="#fr_87">[87]</a>Pronounced <i>ah&acute;la-mo</i>, Spanish for cottonwood. The name
was probably given from cottonwoods growing near by. The
Church of the Alamo was erected in 1744.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_88" href="#fr_88">[88]</a>The reader, curious for details of the San Antonio
Missions, as well as items of local secular history, is referred
to Wm. Corner&rsquo;s &ldquo;San Antonio de B&eacute;xar.&rdquo; He will
also be interested in a picturesque sketch of San Antonio
as it was nearly half a century ago, by the Southern poet
Sidney Lanier, who in quest of health passed the winter
of 1872-3 here, and here made his resolve, faithfully carried
out, to devote the remainder of his life to music and poetry.
The sketch is printed in a collection of Lanier&rsquo;s essays
entitled &ldquo;Retrospects and Prospects.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_89" href="#fr_89">[89]</a>These three Missions were originally located about 15
years earlier on sites some distance from San Antonio.
Scarcity of irrigation water is given as one important cause
of their removal in 1731 to the banks of the San Antonio
River.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_90" href="#fr_90">[90]</a>Silver and gold gave it its start. Its name is believed
to be due to a huge bowlder or globe of silver weighing
300 pounds, found there in 1876.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_91" href="#fr_91">[91]</a>Pronounced <i>Too-son&acute;</i>. It is the name applied by the
neighboring Papago Indians to a mountain at the west of
the present town, and according to Dr. W. J. McGee, means
&ldquo;black base.&rdquo; Tucson&rsquo;s first appearance in history seems
to have been in 1763, as an Indian village whose spiritual
needs were served by the missionaries of San Xavier del
Bac. In 1776 a Spanish pres&iacute;dio was established here, and
the little pueblo became San Agustin de Tucson. An
edifice, originally a church dedicated to St. Augustine but
now a lodging house, still faces the old Spanish plaza of
the town.

the railway, a fact that may be fraught with trouble; for
the river, which is ordinarily insignificant enough to be
crossed on a plank, is capable of becoming after storms a
raging flood 200 feet wide and 20 deep. Under such circumstances,
it is the part of wisdom to motor from Tucson.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_95" href="#fr_95">[95]</a>In the sanctuary were interred, and I suppose still repose,
the bones of the Franciscan Padres Baltasar Carillo

of San Xavier.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_97" href="#fr_97">[97]</a>The following all-day trips are especially recommended:
<p class="bq">1. To Redlands, in the San Bernardino foothills, one
of the most beautiful of California towns, and Riverside
with its famous Mission Inn (about 145 miles the round,
including the ascent of Mt. Roubidoux), traversing a
beautiful orange and lemon district and paralleling the
stately Sierra Madre, whose highest peaks are snow-capped
in winter. (If there is time for another day this
trip may be extended in winter or spring to include the
run to Palm Springs in the desert, 50 miles beyond
Redlands. This is particularly enjoyable in March and
April when the wild flowers of the desert are in bloom&mdash;a
surprising and lovely sight. There is a good hotel at
Palm Springs, but it is safest to arrange ahead for accommodations).</p>
<p class="bq">2. To Mission San Juan Capistrano (about 120 miles
the round), one of the most interesting and poetic in
its half ruin of the old Franciscan California establishments.
The road traverses the rich agricultural districts
tributary to Whittier and Santa Ana, and a portion of
the extensive Irvine, or San Joaquin Ranch (about
100,000 acres). A detour may be made to include Laguna
and Arch Beaches and a run (over an inferior road) of
ten miles overlooking a picturesque rock-bound bit of
Pacific surf.</p>
<p class="bq">3. To Mount Wilson Peak (50 miles the round, but
includes 9 miles of tortuous mountain road with a grade
as high as 23% in one or two spots). On this peak
(6000 feet above the sea) are situated the buildings of
the Carnegie Solar Observatory, which, however, are not
open to the public. The views from the peak are very
beautiful. The trip can also be made by public auto-stage.
There is a hotel at the summit.</p>
<p class="bq">4. To Camulos Rancho (95 miles the round), a good
example of the old style Spanish-California ranch,
utilized by Mrs. Jackson as the scene of part of her
novel &ldquo;Ramona.&rdquo; It is situated in the Santa Clara
Valley of the South. A stop may be made en route at
Mission San Fernando. The return trip may be made
by way of Topanga Ca&ntilde;on and the seaside town of Santa
Monica, if an extra hour can be given to it.</p>
<p class="fncont">Half-day drives in the vicinity of Los Angeles are too
numerous to be itemized here, but the following may be
mentioned:</p>
<p class="bq">1. To the Mission San Fernando by way of Hollywood
(famous for its beautiful homes, and latterly as the
capital of &ldquo;Movie-land&rdquo;) and through the Cahuenga
Pass, returning via the Topanga Ca&ntilde;on, the beach and
Santa Monica.</p>
<p class="bq">2. To Sunland via Alhambra and Santa Anita Avenue
to the Foothill Boulevard, Altadena, and La Ca&ntilde;ada,
returning via Roscoe and Tropico.</p>
<p class="bq">3. To Mission San Gabriel, returning by way of
Pasadena&rsquo;s famous residential districts of Oak Knoll and
Orange Grove Boulevard, thence over the Arroyo Seco
Bridge and past the Annandale Country Club, back to
the city.</p>
<p class="bq">4. To Whittier and the citrus-fruit belt of the San
Gabriel Valley via either Turnbull or Brea Ca&ntilde;ons (the
latter picturesque with oil derricks) returning by the
Valley Boulevard.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
